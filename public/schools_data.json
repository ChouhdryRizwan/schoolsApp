Between us we have decades of experience delivering the British curriculum all over the world. We know what works well and are always looking for ways to improve. Our educational philosophy focuses on empowering children to become independent thinkers and inspired learners by encouraging them to explore and discover for themselves. We do this through the provision of an incredible range of co-curricular options, a rich focus on the arts and the level of academic rigour and extension one would expect from a school like Cranleigh. Indeed, the benefits of our association with Cranleigh UK are substantial and go way beyond a common brand. We actively work together, sharing ideas and best practice through regular meetings and dialogue as well as pupil and teacher exchanges.\nOur aim to build a strong community remains a key focus and in less than two years, our families have joined together with us to form a powerful and positive spirit and a sense of pride that motivates us all. Cranleigh parents are open and honest \u2013 not shy to tell us when they think there is room for improvement but equally quick with positive feedback when it is deserved.\nWe are exceptionally privileged when it comes to facilities. Our state of the art campus and location on Saadiyat Island are truly unique. However, buildings are buildings. What really matters is what happens within them and that\u2019s where our focus lies. We believe that what sets us apart is the fact that we never lose sight of why we chose to work in education in the first place \u2013 to teach and inspire children. The moment a school allows other drivers to dilute this focus, its principles are compromised and standards drop.\nA child\u2019s future success isn\u2019t dictated by academic grades. When the ultimate goal is to produce a confident, well-rounded adult, there is much more to learn than just core subjects. We are opposed to what can be referred to as \u201cteaching to the test.\u201d Instead, we ensure that all our pupils are offered a comprehensive, creative curriculum designed to prepare them for life beyond their school days.\nSummary of ADEK Inspection\nThe overall performance of the school is very good. Students\u2019 achievement is rooted in their outstanding learning skills and personal development. Outstanding teaching at the foundation stage (FS) gives children a real enthusiasm for learning. The first cohort of 37 students to reach Year 11 will take external IGCSE examinations in June 2017. School leaders have an appropriately ambitious vision for the school which drives its direction. Their promotion of Islamic values and the heritage and culture of the UAE permeates its curriculum and ethos. This commitment to the national agenda includes best practice in innovation. For the minority of students for whom it is a first language, the school has not had the same success in promoting high achievement in the Arabic language. The school\u2019s evaluation of its own performance does not yet involve sufficient staff or representatives of all stakeholders.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe range of learning experiences that promote students\u2019 personal development and learning skills\nLeaders\u2019 vision and direction and their promotion of innovation\nTeachers\u2019 knowledge of their subjects and their students\nThe school\u2019s promotion of and students\u2019 respect for Islamic values and their appreciation of the heritage and culture of the UAE\nThe quality of children\u2019s education in the foundation stage.\n",

Together, this gives our Children a highly relevant education, taught in a stimulating, multi-cultural setting, where intellectual development is nurtured alongside personal growth. To deliver the education most suited to our children\u2019s ambition, we offer the respected English National Curriculum with an international dimension, the highly ranked American Massachusetts State Curriculum and the prestigious International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.\nRanked \u201cOutstanding\u201d by the Abu Dhabi Department of Education & Knowledge (ADEK), Aldar Academies is the trusted name in educational excellence across Abu Dhabi and Al Ain.\nSummary of ADEK Inspection\nThe overall performance of the school is good. Students\u2019 good personal development is based on strong relationships between staff and students, positive behavior and attitudes and students\u2019 good knowledge of UAE culture and Islamic values. The school has developed strong partnerships with parents and the community. The current team of school managers took an important decision early in 2017 to refocus learning and teaching towards an enquiry-based approach.

Through the Mascot Manners and Learner DNA we set high expectations whilst providing students with the tools they need to succeed.\nIn 2020, the academy launched a Middle School model for students in Year 5 to Year 8. This model provides and exciting and innovative approach to education and the development of this has been focused upon providing specialist subject teaching, inquiry based learning and developing resilient and solution focused learners.

Students are able to design their own curriculum according to their strengths, interests, further education and career aspirations. Alongside their subject choices\u2019 students will also follow an Enrichment course which is based on the real world in order to develop their interpersonal skills. When students start their Post 16 journey the learning environment will change considerably. Students will learn to work more independently and be self-motivated where setting deadlines and targets for themselves becomes second nature. Resilience and Perseverance are two words our students will hear frequently over the two-year course, where they will always be surrounded by a team of staff that are trained to get the very best from each student.\nThe Ministry of Education system is adhered to across the broad curriculum offered throughout the school, from Nursery to Year 12.

Academically selective and with high aspirations, we are a school that never loses focus of the individual child. Repton is a school where there are many blends: a blend of the pursuit of excellence with a broadening of the mind; a blend in the fulfilment of succeeding as an individual with the pleasure of working as part of a team; and a blend between the investment in self-discovery with an awareness of others. This, as our sister schools refer to, is the \u2018wholeness\u2019 that personifies a Repton education.\nAs one of the best schools in Abu Dhabi, Repton\u2019s approach to education is one of a continual process of discovering, learning and maturing. We encourage capacity for independent thought and action, and then combine this with rational and responsible decision-making.\nWe follow a British independent school curriculum which incorporates elements of the English National Curriculum whilst allowing highly skilled teachers to develop an appropriate curriculum for an independent school in an international environment.\nThe curriculum develops pupils as independent and lifelong learners, as well as encouraging a spirit of intellectual curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge. This is achieved through what is studied in lessons and by links between academic and cross-curricular opportunities.\nSummary of ADEK Inspection\nThe overall performance of Repton Foundation School is very good. The school is in its third year of operation and has responded most effectively to the challenges of a quickly expanding student population from a range of nationalities and cultures. Key strengths are the students\u2019 strong personal and social development, nurtured by the high quality of protection, care, support and guidance in this inclusive community.\nThe large majority of students make better than expected progress and the majority of students attain levels above curriculum standards. Achievement is highest in English where most students demonstrate skills and understanding above appropriate curriculum standards and their progress is better than expected. In the subjects taught in Arabic, attainment levels are generally acceptable and progress is good in relation to appropriate curriculum standards. Students throughout the school demonstrate well-developed learning skills. The progress made by Emiratis and by students with special educational needs (SEN) is very good.\nThe quality of teaching is generally very good. The school uses comprehensive assessment processes and thorough analysis at all levels to inform planning for learning and effectively meet the needs of all students. The curriculum is well planned, adapted and implemented to actively engage students in learning, particularly in subjects taught in English. In all year levels, teachers and students make highly effective use of technology as a tool to enhance teaching and learning. The quality of leadership and management at all levels is very good. The head teacher and deputy head teacher demonstrate skilled strategic leadership and a strong commitment to distributive leadership and teamwork at all levels. This results in staff and parents who are extremely supportive of the senior leaders, the school\u2019s aims and vision, and who are committed to continuous school improvement. Self-evaluation is accurate and leads to well-prioritised and regularly reviewed school development planning. Professional development is continuous and has a very positive impact on the quality of teaching and learning.

Our strength lies in resurrection of core values each day, each year, into the hearts and mind of each student, and create independent thinking, creative and sensitive individuals who will serve as a torch bearer to further ignite many more minds with love, beauty and happiness.\nWe encourage in displaying integrity in thought, word and action, to stand up for what is right and to accept mistakes with grace and positivity.

A strong disciplined and caring environment based on mutual respect, love for each other, nature and all forms of life must prevail in the school.\nAt ADIS, our teachers are innovative, compassionate, approachable and well trained to support and inspire their students for preparing them towards better future. They have always open arms, share a healthy relationship with the students and encourage them to express their ideas and opinions fearlessly. Our belief, as an educator, we need to discover how each child learns, in order to differentiate our instruction to support diverse learning styles; all children are different. We also want all the children to love their school. A successful school does not function in isolation. It is our endeavor to develop a tripolar bonding between the school, the students and the parents, so as to share the collaborative efforts that bring forth spiritual nurturing & effective and successful learning. With our open door policy, we have extensive programs to maximize parental engagement and enhance their role in the development of their wards. They are well informed on the progress and opportunity to contribute and participate in their child\u2019s school experience.

To motivate their children and to help them work towards success and prosperity they strive to provide them with the best living condition, best school, best learning outcome, communicative skills, effective preparation for competitive exams, latest gadgets and so on.\nAt the same time, how do we prepare children for life itself? How should they address conflict, disappointment and misfortune? How will they overcome a setback?\nThe purpose of a school is to develop the skills and intelligence of its children. At the same time a school should also prepare them for life by developing their emotional intelligence and making them God-fearing, resilient, caring, adaptive, reflective, and open-minded to adjust to new situations. This develops confidence to take risks, be innovative and enterprising. We should strive to prepare our children not merely for economic independence and prosperity but also to face life\u2019s challenges with confidence and happiness.\nThe physical, intellectual, spiritual, social and psychological formation received in one\u2019s school speaks volumes about the individual and the institution. At ADIS, we provide all our students with a safe learning environment and the opportunity to develop into well- rounded responsible citizens.\n",

Students\u2019 attitudes, behaviour and their commitment to learning are very good across the school. They demonstrate a real commitment to living safe and healthy lives and a strong sense of responsibility.\nAttainment and progress in most subjects is good.

In all subjects students make good progress from low starting points and by the time they reach Grade 12, they are achieving above curriculum expectations. Students\u2019 speaking, listening and reading skills in Arabic and English are particularly strong. The quality of learning skills is acceptable in the large section of the KG and primary school. Learning skills are more effectively developed in the middle and high schools with students demonstrating a wider range of higher order and critical thinking skills in these phases.\nThe quality of teaching and assessment has improved and the majority of lessons are now good or better. Assessment information is available but not used consistently to plan effective lessons that support the needs of students who find learning difficult or those who are more able. The curriculum is adequately planned and enhanced to ensure progression and continuity in knowledge and skills. The principal has set a clear and strong agenda for improvement and has introduced a number of new developments in the past two years.

It has shown continuous improvement over this time and now provides a good standard of education overall. English is the second language of almost all students. Governors have appointed new senior leaders and staff since the last inspection. Only the minority of students stay in the school for more than two years. High turnover has limited the school's progress in raising attainment. The school has raised entrance requirements and this has ensured that students entering the school are capable of learning successfully in the medium of English. The very high student turnover has therefore reduced, and improved progress is now evident in a more stable student cohort.\nThe overall performance of the school is good because students are now making good progress across the majority of subjects. Progress is consistently good English medium subjects in the foundation and primary phases that account for over three-quarters of the school\u2019s population. Attainment has risen sharply in nearly all subjects in these phases from weak to acceptable, although Arabic standards remain weak in primary. Considerable improvement in the quality of the curriculum and the effective use of assessment can be attributed to strong leadership, particularly in the primary phase. Students in the foundation and primary phases now benefit from enjoyable and challenging learning experiences. There has been less marked improvement in the middle and high phases.\nStudents are now making good progress across the majority of subjects although achievement is variable across the phases.\nIn kindergarten (KG) children are making good progress in building on their existing skills, enhanced by engaging activities and good teacher support.\nStudents' progress in the primary is good in subjects taught in English due to considerable improvement in teaching and learning; but only acceptable in subjects taught in Arabic.\nStudents' attainment in the middle and high phases is weaker because their learning is being built on weak foundation skills and knowledge, and they are not actively taking responsibility for their own learning.\nStudents behave well, and most have positive attitudes to their learning.\nStudents demonstrate, in their conduct and attitudes, positive Islamic values and pride in their heritage and culture.\nStudents, particularly those in higher years, do not develop enough independence and initiative, for example through organising events and taking leadership roles around the school.\nThe skills of teachers have improved because the large majority have been replaced with skilled teachers, experienced in delivering the English national curriculum. The remaining staff have been supported by good quality continuous professional development.\nTeachers' plans cover the curriculum outcomes and those in KG and primary give good attention to delivering the curriculum in an engaging way. Most, particularly those in the primary, provide good quality support to students during lessons.\nTeaching and assessment in the middle and high phases are not meeting students' needs. Direct teaching and low-level tasks are limiting these students' progress.\nThe curriculum has been reviewed and developed to deliver the English national curriculum effectively.\nIn the primary phase, topics based on children's stories engage students and help them to develop their English skills, make connections between curriculum subjects and understand the purpose of their learning.\nThe curriculum is not adapted well enough to meet the needs of students with special educational needs, or to promote the skills required for innovation and enterprise.\nThe school is very well maintained and provides high-quality, safe, hygienic facilities. Students are supported to develop healthy lifestyles and respect for others.\nStudents benefit from positive relationships with teachers. They behave responsibly and are kind to one another.\nArrangements to identify students with special educational needs are now robust.\nA very strong leadership team in the KG and primary phases have made considerable improvement in provision and outcomes for students.\nThe governing board has taken prompt and decisive action to raise standards. They have replaced all of the school's leaders, and the majority of the teachers, and upgraded the school's resources to support more successfully the delivery of the curriculum\nGovernors and senior leaders have won the confidence of many parents and the rate of student turnover has reduced.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nStudents' good behaviour and positive relationships between students and staff.\nStudents' understanding of UAE culture and their Islamic values.\nSupport for students' learning in English as a second language across the curriculum.\nThe development of the curriculum to provide progressive learning experiences linked to the English national curriculum.\nThe high-quality learning environment and resources.\n",

Administrators, teachers, and students are all contributors to this team. Knowledge and ideas are the product of the team effort. Since students are the ones who benefit most directly from the product, they should be most concerned that the product is of a high quality.\nEveryone in a SABIS\u00ae Network school has a job to do; everyone is accountable. Administrators, students, and staff \"self-audit\" in order to discover and correct errors. It is teamwork that allows every team member to reach heights that would be more difficult to reach individually.\nThe SABIS\u00ae Educational System is an educational approach that has been developed, refined, and tested for over a century to provide a truly international education that is geared towards the achievement of academic excellence.\nWith a balance of academics, self-development, and life preparation, the SABIS\u00ae Educational System prepares its students for success in college, fosters a lifelong interest in learning, and develops responsible world-class citizens.

It provides a sound, thorough, and high standard of education.\nLike other SABIS\u00ae Network schools, SABIS\u00ae International School - Ruwais offers courses leading to a wide range of external examinations that include the U.S. Advanced Placement\u00ae (AP\u00ae) exams, the SAT & TOEFL exams, and the British IGCSE & AS/A Level exams.

This foundation will help students achieve their full potential and develop a love of lifelong learning.\nAll courses for students at all levels are clearly structured to enable students and teachers to know precisely what should be learned. Teachers teach one concept at a time using the SABIS Point System\u00ae with each lesson alternating frequently between oral work, individual work, and group work in such a way that it is difficult for students to \u201cswitch off.\u201d\nStudents engage in regular assessment using exams that teachers do not see in advance. Everyone in the school is accountable. Accordingly, students learn more in class and have more time for relaxation and fun after school.\nEmphasizing a well-balanced body of knowledge, skills, and experiences, the curriculum at SABIS\u00ae International School - Ruwais specifies daily learning goals at all grade levels. In an atmosphere that fosters the development of a lifelong love of learning, students are shown how to study and given the support they need to develop a solid academic foundation.\nStarting in Grade 4, courses at SABIS\u00ae International School - Ruwais will specify a minimum number of \"units of information\" that students need to learn. This minimum includes the simple concepts tested by the AMS, as well as Basic Questions which test the material that \"everyone should know.\" In addition to this, SABIS\u00ae International School - Ruwais courses from Grade 4 onwards will include extended material for more able students.

The attainment and progress of students have risen over the last two years. Most students who graduate at Grade 12 are able to gain entry to universities in the UAE or in other countries. The Kindergarten (KG) is a strength of the school where young children are provided with a happy and successful start to their life in school. Despite arriving with limited understanding of English, almost all students make good progress so that they are able to use their English skills to gain full access to the American curriculum. The behaviour of students has improved since the last inspection and is now good. The school provides a calm and orderly environment. The quality of teaching is good as most lessons are well prepared and provide students with a range of interesting activities. Students in Grades 6 to 12 have insufficient access in classrooms to modern digital technologies. They are not provided with enough opportunities during lessons or through homework to undertake independent or collaborative research. The leadership and management of the school is good. Senior leaders invite trust and loyalty from their staff. Self-evaluation has been devolved so that a large number of staff now make contributions to the process and this has helped provide a more accurate assessment of the school\u2019s performance.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe progress made by the school since the last inspection\nThe vibrant learning environment created in the KG and progress made by students in the KG and primary departments phases\nThe strong family atmosphere that supports students\u2019 personal and social development\nThe spoken English skills of students throughout the school\nThe self-evaluation process provides an accurate picture of the school\u2019s strengths and areas for improvement\nThe use of innovative strategies in the curriculum to promote student learning\n",

The principal, her senior management team and subject coordinators have a shared commitment to raise standards through continuous improvement. The behaviour of girls is good around the school and in lessons. Boys\u2019 behaviour has improved since the last inspection and is now good in almost all lessons and around the school. Relationships and attitudes to study are very good and learning skills, including creative thinking,innovation and entrepreneurship, are strengths of the school. Attainment overall is good and close to age-related expectations, but the analysis of data by the school in relation to external benchmarks needs to be strengthened. The school provides a dedicated special educational needs (SEN) co-ordinator who provides additional support to students. The school identifies gifted and talented students but does not reflect their specific needs in lesson planning. Teaching is good overall with few examples of very good and outstanding teaching. Students have a very good understanding of Islamic values and a very good appreciation of UAE culture and history. This is evident in assemblies and in the school\u2019s participation in the \u2018My Identity\u2019 programme. The school is well maintained and resourced and provides a very good learning environment for students.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe quality of educational provision in kindergarten\nDevelopment and understanding of Islamic values and UAE culture and traditions\nThe development of learning skills, in particular entrepreneurship, Innovation and critical thinking.\n",

The curriculum also provides a wide range of extra-curricular activities that students enjoy.\nAt our school, education is renowned for concerning itself with the development of the whole personality. Learning is important, but not enough in itself.

We place great emphasis to meet the needs of all students, stretching brighter children and supporting those who need it through differentiated teaching and learning activities. The curriculum extends and excites all students, whatever their interests or ability. Through it, teachers are able to identify, celebrate and nurture the talents and intelligences of students.\nOne of the most essential life skills is developing an understanding of, and a respect for others. We embrace this concept through nurturing and fostering this respect for one another within both our immediate community and the world in which we live. We encourage our children to identify similarities rather than differences among cultures and to celebrate and respect other people\u2019s beliefs, opinions, and customs.\nWe place significant value on the development of problem solving and thinking skills. We recognize that the process of reaching an outcome is as important as the activity or content of a lesson.

Among the many who took the opportunity were Filipino Overseas Contract Workers (OCW\u2019s) \u2013 as they have been called before it was changed to the present Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW\u2019s) \u2013 to work in the gas and oil industry of the fast-growing emirate or in other sectors which started to mushroom all over or around Abu Dhabi.\nStrict immigration laws were loosened to attract more workers for Abu Dhabi\u2019s planned development. In turn, Filipino OCW\u2019s either brought their families along with them or the families followed after the OCW\u2019s settled. The families included not only the OCW\u2019s wives but their children as well.\nA problem among the expanding Filipino community arose, however, as there were no Filipino schools then. Thus, Filipino parents were forced to send their children to international schools. After years of their employment had stabilized, a group of parents took the initiative to consult with other parents for the possible creation of a Filipino school, manned by Filipino teachers, and managed by Filipino investors. Like a wild bush fire, the inspiration spread, and every Filipino, who believed that the education of their children was the best investment they can ever hope for, enthusiastically supported the idea of putting up a Filipino school and several Filipino School has sprouted.\nOn September 2013, the then Philippine Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Her Excellency Grace Relucio Princesa, cut the ceremonial ribbon assisted by the school\u2019s Founder and CEO, Ms. Nelia D.

The International Benchmark Test of Australia also acknowledged PEPS\u2019 students\u2019 high achievements in English, Math, and Science. The Abu Education Council, the educational governing body of the emirates has recently chosen Philippine Emirates Private School as one of its pilot schools (Filipino curriculum).\nThe Philippine-Emirates Private School, which envisions itself to be the sole and ultimate provider of high quality of education in the United Arab Emirates for the Filipinos, continues to search for avenues to assure the stakeholders \u2013 parents and learners \u2013 the consistent delivery of high quality education which has become this institution\u2019s trademark since its inception. Indeed, the Philippine-Emirates Private School\u2019s belief in the Filipino children\u2019s right to acquire quality education at par with the international standards is clearly manifested in its adherence to a strict standard of selection for its faculty members and staff who are all tasked to meet the challenge of maintaining this institution\u2019s tradition of excellence.

For students wanting to stay close to the UAE, of course, that too is available to them. While not easily earned, an Alberta High School Diploma provides graduates with a solid foundation for continuing their education.\nWe are very proud of the accomplishment of our accreditation. It is attained through achieving high standards of performance in programming and assessment. Having Alberta, Canadian certified teachers is an accreditation requirement for every teacher teaching in the Canadian program. Canadian Teacher training is exceptional and highly prized around the world. We strive to hire Canadian Teachers, many of our teachers are Canadian. Those that come from other countries add to the mosaic of our school and have all gone through the scrutiny of Alberta, Canadian certification due to their training in similar University programs abroad. All of our teachers measure up to the high Canadian standard that our program demands of them.\nIn addition to the strong academics, the school offers well rounded opportunities for students to participate in extracurricular activities including sports, arts and drama. Maplewood Canadian International School was awarded the highest commendation in the region for the innovative ways we support student learning with technology. Students use laptops to support their learning. A major focus of our efforts is dedicated to always ensuring digital awareness and safety. When the school shifted to an Online Learning model due to the COVID 19 pandemic, our students and staff transitioned effectively. Abu Dhabi Education and Knowledge ranked Maplewood at the top for the smooth transition in the face of this challenge.\nStudents from Grade 3 to 12 have their own dedicated device to support learning while younger students use technology within the classroom as part of their lessons on a daily basis. The school is fully equipped with interactive whiteboards or digital screens in all instructional spaces. Reliable High Speed WiFi is available throughout the entire facility. Mastering the use of the internet is a requirement for all students and teachers. The technical skills of our students support them in problem solving through research and project based learning as common modes of instruction in our school.\nAcademic facilities include a learning commons with over 10,000 titles in print and/or digital format making it one of the finest school libraries in Abu Dhabi. Language development in reading and writing is emphasized in all classes and subjects. For most of our students, English is not their first language. Our teachers know this and ensure that their instructional techniques take this into consideration. All teachers are English teachers first, who may then teach mathematics, science, art etc.\nA competitive size swimming pool, large gymnasium and sports field provides space for physical activities. Covered play areas and other spaces increase the areas for students. KG and Primary students have dedicated creative playgrounds.\nAs educators we know that all students have unique talents and needs. At Maplewood Canadian International School, we believe first and foremost in the community we are striving to build. We believe every child has the potential to learn and it is our responsibility to provide the opportunities to make that happen to every extent possible.\nAt Maplewood Canadian International School, we believe in the importance of family. We recognise that the school is a microcosm of the larger community. A child\u2019s first lessons are learned in community and family. As an extension we believe the school needs to be a community that is safe and supportive of the child. This support facilitates learning. A school where brothers and sisters study together reinforces this which is why we encourage families to entrust us to their children. Our school program serves children from KG1 to Grade 12 and our latest addition of a Canadian MapleBear Nursery extends that scope even more!\n",

The lack of a clear focus and direction by senior leaders means that there is much discontent amongst the staff, students and parents. The school has not effectively addressed recommendations to improve the school performance, due to a lack of understanding and capacity by leaders and governors.\nThe achievement levels of most students are below both national and international standards and show no signs of improvement over time. The quality of teaching is very weak; one of the reasons for this is the high turnover of teachers. The delivery of the curriculum is not modified to meet the needs of most students, particularly the more able and those with special educational needs (SEN). Almost all students are unable to meet their potential and develop their independence, due to the lack of high expectations across the school.\nStudents\u2019 appreciation and understanding of the Islamic values, and UAE culture are developed well.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nAcceptable attainment and progress in Arabic as a second language across the school\nAcceptable attainment and progress of children in Kindergarten (KG) across the majority of key subjects\nGirls\u2019 engagement in learning, particularly in the high school\nStudents\u2019 appreciation and understanding of the Islamic values of UAE culture.\n",

Thank you for your interest in our school! GISAD was founded in 1976 and we are proud of our long history in the United Arab Emirates. In 2006/2007 GISAD was officially recognized as part of the German International School Network. Since then all certificates issued by us are fully recognized in Germany: As recognized educational institutes (regardless of their origin), our students have equal access to all offers of the German education system, with the Abitur in particular to colleges and universities in Germany and worldwide.\nOur teaching staffs are well trained (state examinations for teachers, state diplomas for educators) and contribute experience from the German-speaking world and international experience. We pursue the goal of enabling our students to have a successful school career that will pave the way for a promising future by providing them not only with excellent knowledge but also with fundamentals of the German culture and a high level of intercultural competence.\nIn 2005/2006, GISAD received a generous donation from the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, H.H. Mohammed bin Zayed, which enabled us to move into our spacious and modern school building and expand our academic offerings. The H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed scholarship enabled GISAD to integrate Emirati children from kindergarten age into our school community for the first time. In the school year 2018/2019 we proudly awarded our first Emirati student with the German International Abitur.\nThe German International Abitur is our highest qualification and is achieved at the end of grade 12 after the students have passed a number of exams. Our Abitur certifies a profound and broad knowledge and extended skills in the world language English through bilingual subjects which we teach from the intermediate level onwards. It enables students to study at universities and colleges worldwide, not least in Germany, Austria or Switzerland, but also here in the Emirates.\nOur school career path is characterized by the fact that the linguistic skills are very specifically promoted already in kindergarten. For some children the first priority is to become fluent in the German language. In addition, the offer \u201cArabic for native speakers\u201d begins in kindergarten. The German-speaking children receive language support tailored to their needs with a wide range of educational opportunities and English lessons from the very beginning. From the first grade on, the lessons are German-speaking. Only children who have a good command of German can transfer to the GISAD primary school. However, we offer additional linguistic support to students with a different mother tongue during and after lessons. For children whose mother tongue is not Arabic, lessons in Arabic as a foreign language also begin in the first grade.\nWith the transition to the lower secondary level (from grade 5), our students are classified as Realschule students or Gymnasium students. From grade 6 on, based on their overall guidance regarding their future school career they follow the respective career path. The teachers carry out these assessments and are in close contact with the parents in this respect. A later change of classification is possible depending on the further development of the children. From grade 9 onwards, some subjects are taught bilingually (German and English).\nGISAD is an all-day school that offers after-school care facilities. Our after-school program offers a variety of options, also through cooperation with extra-curricular partners, to relieve parents of after-school supervision and homework assistance.\nOur mission statement is intended to be a framework for all those involved in school life and following a common path to the future. At the same time, it shall help remind us of the realization of our goals.\nThe GISAD mission statement was decided at the overall teachers conference on May 24, 2017:\n\u201cAt GISAD we learn and live in a culturally diverse environment and work together every day to realize our visions.\u201d\n",

The learning experience is enriching for young learners as it is well integrated with RYAN core values and the Abu Dhabi Economic vision of 2030 which promotes 13 main competencies and prepares the students in 21st century skills. Teaching entails a new experience for young Ryanites as it is cross curricular & theme based. This is complemented with exciting hands-on learning experience & imaginative educational tours.\nWe value collaborative learning, positive relationships and building healthy relations with all to effectively allow students to engage in the world of the future, where problem solving, evaluating, working in teams, communicating, creating and innovating are not only concepts, but expected skills, attributes and capabilities. We aim that every student knows that they are important, valued, respected and they wind up the afternoon with happy and joyful thoughts.\n\u2018One is not born into the world to do everything but to do something\u2019, says HD Thoreau. We here help identify that \u201csomething\u201d within each individual so that they can lead their life with choice and design. We endeavor to disseminate to these young brains lessons that imbibe outside the horizons of a closed textbook. Besides the core curriculum, we believe in imparting the importance of values, the strength of an upright character, the ability to make a difference, the reason to be a human and the pride and profundity of being a Ryanite to compete with their global counterparts. Ryan\u2019s is a friendly, vibrant, community-minded school, whose decisions always put our students first. We are very keen to involve our community in our learning, developing true partnerships that value each student. There are many opportunities for parental and community involvement and we believe in partnering with our stakeholders so that you feel very much a part of our school and it's warm and generous community.\nTo make the world a better place is what we aim to develop in Ryan students. Our approach therefore is to impart education and create a renewed sense of enlightenment. The magnitude of which is well capable of establishing an individual's development to the highest level. The KASSM approach is a means that has become a guiding example, using the concept of learning out of its old conditioning. We take this concept forward by the gradual unraveling of one's inner potential through the right mix of academia and other related activities for enriched living. Hence, Ryanites are Kings and Queens in the making. Our institutions provide a learning environment that focuses on all-round development of the child.\nRyan International Group aims to be a premier global educational institution developing young minds into the leaders of tomorrow.\nOur institutions cultivate children's all-round development in their moral and social skills, giving them an edge against peers.\nWe instill the fundamental values of Integrity, Obedience, Humility, Trustworthiness, Punctuality, Dedication and love of Lord among our students. We nurture the contributing citizens of tomorrow and cultivate the change makers of coming time through initiatives like School Parliament and School Council.\nWe follow our motto \"Excellence in Education & All-Round Development\" in letter and spirit and develop learners for life. Our inspiring educators deliver learner centric tech-enabled experiential 21st Century curriculum, aimed at developing KASSM (Knowledge, Attitude, Skills, Social Values and Moral Values)\nOur structured physical education and specific sports as part of the curriculum train students to become the champions of tomorrow in the sports arena at national & international levels. We conduct social impact and environment awareness projects in all schools - plantation drives and rallies on a regular basis. \"Each One, Plant One\", is instilled in our learners right from primary years of learning.\nWe conduct social impact and environment awareness projects in all schools - plantation drives and rallies on a regular basis. \"Each One, Plant One\", is instilled in our learners right from primary years of learning.\n",

We stress to all our students that what really matters is not just gaining qualifications for their own sake but learning - always being open to personal growth, having a attitude that welcomes and tackles problems and being flexible when times get tough.\nThis is a very significant achievement and is only possible due to the high caliber teaching staff and a competent leadership team. This achievement becomes even more significant by the fact that 2014 will witness the graduation of its 28th batch of school leavers.\nOur students and our exceptional staff team are our two most prized assets.

In our meetings, we share with you our vision of growth and expectations for your child for the year ahead, but we will also seek to understand your aspirations for your child so that we develop these personal goals and targets together.\nStudents develop expertise across the disciplines of Science, Social Studies & PSHCE through integrated units of study designed to provoke inquiry, raise engagement, and harness 21st-century skills.

As living cannot be postponed, the experience of schooling has to be understood as an end in itself where the child, parent, teacher and management come together for mutual growth. Schools have the responsibility to provide such a platform and a scheme for mutual interaction of its community. It is such an integration of space, learning and technology that characterises, The International Indian School in Ajman.\nThe school envisages learning as a communitarian process of imbibing education from the natural, academic, social and technological ecosystems created around the institution of school.\nWe strive to provide a new model of education for the expatriate children in the UAE in a culturally inclusive, technologically effective and ecologically sensitive way in a cosmopolitan environment.\nAll members of the school community, their cultures, nationalities and regions are considered and respected equally, strictly as per the UAE laws, in a way that is sensitive to the global character of the school. At Habitat School, nobody should feel excluded in any way. All members of the School should be treated according to the principles of natural and social justice, where nothing unfair happens against anybody. Everyone should be treated with dignity, without any harshness in any aspects. All actions connected to the school should be transparent and all members including the managing team should be accountable. The school is committed to the pursuit of excellence, striving to improve itself in all educational activities all the time.\nSchool is where a child spends most of its quality time. It is the space of socialization and a window to the world. The curriculum is only one of the many ways of learning life in school. Hence, at HABITAT, the space is designed in such a way that children spent a great deal of time in the school, with each other, and their teachers in specially designed spaces. For those interested, the school also provides day boarding facilities where they are provided with enjoyable and educating time. The look and feel and the character of the space will equip the school in this process.\nThere is a good deal of free space and land for children's interaction and this will be integrated with regular academic work. Though all the modern facilities such as synthetic track and play areas are in built, the organic feel will be its main attraction which the school considers it central to its mission.\nThere have been a lot of changes in the nature of teaching practices in recent years- people have been talking against rote learning, teachers are now projected to be facilitators and many have voiced their concerns about the inabilities of the current educational system. But the reform efforts have not been realistic in any way. Though the theory for the reforms has been quite solid, teaching and evaluation remain wide apart. The traditional virtues of education get lost and the new methodologies come up as hugely flawed. In such a situation, it is very important to have a system in which the learning objectives are clearly identified and activities are clearly designed for an organic experience of learning.\nInformation Technology has, famously, brought people together but its impact in the educational sphere has not been very substantial. Cyber revolution has immense potential for providing a connecting link between all the people involved in the school seamlessly. If such information channels are smartly created and used, the new technologies will have a salutary effect on the students and school alike. Training to use web sources, learning through social networking, creation of interest in web-based academic and scientific activities are core to this segment at HABITAT!\nAlongside having a state-of-the-art infrastructure, the school will also incorporated technological architecture for learning through online sessions, digitised processes and technologically enhanced coming together in the cultural arena.\nThe Habitat International Indian School prides itself in providing quality education that stay true to the changing pedagogy and educational needs of the present day generation. Our digital classrooms make sure that learning is done in its complete quintessence with the help of the latest learning aids.\n",

It is such an integration of space, learning and technology that characterises, THE HABITAT SCHOOL in Al Jurf.\nThe school envisages learning as a communitarian process of imbibing education from the natural, academic, social and technological ecosystems created around the institution of school.\nWe strive to provide a new model of education for the expatriate children in the UAE in a culturally inclusive, technologically effective and ecologically sensitive way in a cosmopolitan environment.\nAll members of the school community, their cultures, nationalities and regions are considered and respected equally, strictly as per the UAE laws, in a way that is sensitive to the global character of the school. At Habitat School, nobody should feel excluded in any way. All members of the School should be treated according to the principles of natural and social justice, where nothing unfair happens against anybody. Everyone should be treated with dignity, without any harshness in any aspects.\nThe school is committed to the pursuit of excellence, striving to improve itself in all educational activities all the time. All actions connected to the school should be transparent and all members including the managing team should be accountable.\nSchool is where a child spends most of its quality time. It is the space of socialization and a window to the world. The curriculum is only one of the many ways of learning life in school. Hence, at HABITAT, the space is designed in such a way that children spent a great deal of time in the school, with each other, and their teachers in specially designed spaces. For those interested, the school also provides day boarding facilities where they are provided with enjoyable and educating time. The look and feel and the character of the space will equip the school in this process. There is a good deal of free space and land for children\u2019s interaction and this will be integrated with regular academic work. Though all the modern facilities such as synthetic track and play areas are in built, the organic feel will be its main attraction which the school considers it central to its mission.\n",

With the discovery of oil, the UAE was investing heavily in itself, and the economy was booming. The influx of expats coming from Pakistan seeking jobs and a better life skyrocketed, and it soon became apparent that as these expats came, they would need a place to educate their children. At the time, there were no options for Pakistani expatriates to enroll their children in quality Islamic education under the Pakistan National Curriculum, and schools that did exist were very costly. Many of the expat children were unable to attend school as a result or were forced to enter the workforce in stead of a classroom.\nThus, Omar Bin Al Khattab Pakistan Islamia School was born, first opening its doors in 1980 in Ajman with only a few classrooms and limited resources. The school opened with the commitment to help educate the underprivileged: anyone coming through their doors seeking a better life and better opportunities for their children that they would not be otherwise able to give or afford.\nThe demand for schooling quickly grew, with much of the student body represented by families fleeing war, poverty, and oppression. The community rallied around OBK School, allowing for growth, expansion, and better resources through donations and charity pledges.\nToday, OBK School serves over 700 students, more than half of who are educated through charity grants from the UAE government, the rest through private donations. As a non-profit organization, and an Islamic school with strong values and ideals, OBK has made a pledge to the community to help every child in need. We believe that education is a right, not a privilege. By the grace of God, the love of the community, and the support of the UAE government, Omar Bin Al Khattab Pakistan Islamia School continues to uphold its mission of providing quality education with sound Islamic values to all those who need their help.\nTo transfer learning to life beyond the classroom, enabling each student to flourish as a responsible citizen in the global community.\nTo empower every student to become a life-long learner who is a responsible, productive and engaged citizen within the global community.\nOur staff, our teachers, our administration, our community all work tirelessly to provide for every child in need of an education, regardless of race, religion, or nationality. However we can, whatever we can, we do, and by the grace of God.\n",

This less-familiar concept of innovation is more novel. This type of innovation is really important. For example, if a developer can create a new battery for an IPhone that is ten cents less expensive and lasts on average 48 minutes longer, this \u201csmall improvement\u201d can shift and change a whole market.\nAt Manor Hall, we want staff and students to engage in both of these types of innovation. It\u2019s the big idea and the small improvement that can both change the world.\nAs a leading international school in Al Ain, MHIS has two operating systems \u2013 a traditional teaching and learning operating system that operates reliably and efficiently to execute and deliver on our mission every day, and a research and development operating system that resembles a network. R&D at MHIS focuses on sustained innovation for relevant learning.\n",

They know how to live healthy lifestyles but their attainment in most core subjects is weak. While some aspects of teaching are good, especially in Grades 4 and 5, the overall effectiveness of teaching is weak in almost half of all lessons. In the minority of lessons in Grades 2 and 3, boys often lose interest and misbehave. This affects the learning and progress of other students. The principal and newly formed senior leadership team are aware of the situation and also the problems associated with the recent high turnover of staff and rapid rise in student numbers.

Children can be admitted to the Nursery classes at the age of 3 (by September 1st) and continue, in Secondary, to take A level examinations at age 18.\nThe school site is in distinct areas with an Early Years Foundation Stage block housing Nursery and Reception classes, a Key Stage 1 block housing Year 1 and 2 children and a KS2 annex for Year 3. Our Year 4, 5 and 6 children have their classrooms in the main school building. Secondary students move around the school campus to each department for their lessons, whilst also spending daily time with their form tutor discussing their pastoral needs.\nIn the Administration block, we have offices for the Principal, Head of Primary, the Office Manager, and the Admissions and Accounts team. Please come and make inquiries from the Primary Administrator at any time: the security guards will happily escort you through the school site. The Secondary Leadership Team and Secondary Administrator are based in the main building. The school employs a medical team of three nurses to oversee the well-being of everyone on site, who will care for your child and contact you should there be any need. We have several outdoor shaded play areas, which offer exciting and modern opportunities for pupils to climb, slide and socialize in addition to being valuable outdoor learning environments.\nWe also value our quiet areas which allow children the choice of taking part in games with each other or sitting quietly and talking with friends. Our PE lessons take place indoors and outdoors and we are proud of our purpose-built swimming pool and gymnasium. Facilities also include libraries for both primary and secondary students, which are visited regularly throughout the week. School also is home to the Al Ain Community Library, open to the public on a Friday. A large hall with a stage and lighting is a central feature of AAESS and is used regularly for assemblies, award ceremonies, and performances. Parents and pupils share in whole school celebrations throughout the year and enjoy the positive climate of achievement that is created.\nSummary of ADEK Inspection\nThe quality of education provided at Al Ain English Speaking School is weak. Teaching is too variable, especially between different phases of the school and between subjects taught in Arabic and those taught in English. As a result progress overall is weak. Progress and learning is particularly weak in the primary phase, where the majority of students are. The recently appointed senior leadership team have ensured that the school is a safe and caring environment in which to learn. They have maintained the school\u2019s vision to provide all-through schooling based upon the traditions of the British educational system. Aspiration and encouragement underpin the school\u2019s ethos; this is reflected in the good iGCSE and Advanced level examination results the large majority of students attain. The quality of the buildings and resources are good. Students conduct themselves well and are positive about their education. The school fully integrates students with\nspecial educational needs (SEN) into classes.\nStudents\u2019 attainment in external examinations at the end of Year 11 is above international averages, especially in the key subjects of mathematics, English and the sciences. At the end of Year 13, students\u2019 attainment in examinations is also high in the sciences. Students in the primary school make weak progress. This is mainly because teachers are not adapting lessons consistently well for students whose first language is not English. Throughout the school, attainment in the subjects taught in Arabic is weak. This is because teachers are not giving students enough opportunity to speak and write in Arabic. Teachers are not applying the school\u2019s assessment policy consistently and setting targets to help students to improve. The support given to students with SEN and those who are gifted and talented is underdeveloped.\nSchool\u2019s Strengths\nAttainment and progress in the foundation stage\nStandards reached and the qualifications gained by students at the end of Year 11, particularly in the key subjects of English, mathematics and the sciences\nCare shown towards students and the attitudes students demonstrate towards their teachers, each other and their learning\nThe understanding of the school\u2019s strengths and areas for development demonstrated by the principal and the senior leadership team\nThe quality of the premises and the learning resources available to teachers and students.\n",

We develop innovative and skillful leaders, who have a strong sense of responsibility towards the global community, as well as a respect and tolerance for those who are different from themselves and a loyalty and respect for their culture and heritage.\nWe are committed to equipping students with 21st Century Skills, including the use of technology, critical thinking skills and innovation to ensure our students are college and career ready.

All you need to do is fill out the volunteer paperwork in the office. We appreciate our parents\u2019 dedication to making our school a positive and engaging community.\nSummary of ADEK Inspection\nThe overall performance of the school is good. Over an extended period, the principal has sustained and developed the quality of education provided through clear direction and vision for improvement. The quality of leadership has been strengthened through the appointment of an academic vice-principal to the senior leadership team. Children in the kindergarten (KG) flourish because of the care and support provided. This is particularly true for students with special educational needs (SEN). The school enjoys positive partnerships with parents. They are encouraged to be involved in their children\u2019s education. Students entering the school from other countries are welcomed and made to feel part of the school community. Teaching and learning in Arabic-medium subjects is good overall.

While the CAIE is primarily followed for English, Math and Science, the English National Curriculum is followed for Art, Music, Design Technology, History and Geography and Computer Science. CAIE prepares school students for life, helping them develop an informed curiosity and a lasting passion for learning and its qualifications are recognised by the world\u2019s best universities and employers, giving students a wide range of options in their education and career.\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Education, all children learn Arabic and UAE Social Studies. In addition, Muslim children study Islamic Studies.\nMoral Education Programme is delivered through a cross-curricular approach.\nThe curriculum is divided into three sections:\nEarly Years (KG1)\nPrimary (KG2 to Grade 5)\nSecondary (Grades 6 to 8)\nLearners are assessed continuously and standardised assessments are used to evaluate each student\u2019s attainment and progress. A variety of strategies and tools are used to evaluate, measure, record and support the progress of our students. A comprehensive and effective learning outcome tracker enables tracking pupil progress. A range of assessment techniques is employed to identify progress towards specific assessment criteria leading to end of year expectations and thereby completing tracking digitally using WT (working towards), ME (meeting expectations), EXC (exceeding expectations) as indicators of attainment. These are designed trackers to track the learning outcomes of CAIE according to the skills, concepts and knowledge aquisition which would ensure progression and continuity across the curriculum. The tracking system explicitly shows next steps in learning therefore identifying clearly the needs of every student. It is through an effective tracking system that the school develops a clear understanding of how to raise student standards according to the expectation of each grade level.\nAs the global society continues to expand, education plays a pivotal role as we prepare students to be global citizens. The future is perpetually challenging and we take it as our responsibility to encourage thoughtful minds, instill discipline and embrace values. We are committed to providing an educational experience which meets international standards with world-class facilities. The children in UAE, which is home for more than 200 nationalities, are raised and educated in such a large multicultural environment. This is certainly a rare opportunity GCBS is proud to have staff and students from over 50 countries around the world. This is certainly a rare opportunity that the school children the UAE enjoy.\n",

Students feel safe in the school and the good relationships between teachers and students are a strength. Students\u2019 understanding of UAE culture and history and their appreciation of Islamic values are also strengths. Behaviour is good in almost all lessons and students in all grades have a good attitude to their work. Students in the high school phase have a particularly good attitude to their work in preparation for examinations. Attainment is at least acceptable in all phases and good in the high school phase. Teaching is acceptable overall, which enables most students of all abilities to make age-appropriate progress. The exceptions are in Arabic where achievement is weak in primary and middle school phases, and in mathematics and science in the KG. The best lessons are characterised by careful planning and the provision of a range of activities, enabling students to make good progress. The range and quality of resources to support effective teaching and assessment is insufficient. School leaders are not monitoring teaching and learning well enough. In particular, they do not ensure that assessment data informs and improves students\u2019 achievement.\nSchool\u2019s Strengths\nStudents\u2019 attainment in the external examination results in the high school phase, which are very high in comparison with other schools taking the same examinations\nStrong relationships between teachers and students and amongst students\nStudents\u2019 behaviour and attitudes to learning which help them to make progress in their work\nStudents\u2019 respect for the heritage and culture of the UAE.\n",

Great importance is laid on Arabic, Islamic Studies and UAE culture studies, while not diluting the internationally recognized Cambridge curriculum.\nOur curriculum and our approach to teaching and learning are based on the standards of Cambridge International Examinations with the inclusion of Arabic Language, UAE Social Studies and Islamic Education.\nGlobal English School epitomizes the new class of professional educational institutions in the UAE. From a modest beginning in 1982, the institution has grown many folds and accommodates more than 1500 students belonging to as many as 40 countries now.

The new senior leadership team joined the school at the start of this year. The school roll has fallen since the last inspection. During the inspection, all students from Grades 10, 11 and 12 were on exam leave. A small number of older students met with the inspection team to discuss their work and share their learning experiences\nAchievement is acceptable in most subjects. In mathematics, achievement is good in Middle. In KG, the development of children\u2019s phonics knowledge and skills is weak. The achievement of students in High is weak in Arabic as a second language. Overall student\u2019s learning skills are acceptable, but student\u2019s ability to tackle problems through innovative and creative approaches is less well developed.\nStudents\u2019 personal and social development is good. Relationships among the students and all adults in school are caring and positive. Students\u2019 understanding of Islamic values, which they apply, and the culture of the UAE are good. Attendance is very good.\nTeaching and assessment are acceptable overall. Teachers\u2019 subject knowledge is secure. Differentiated tasks support the learning of most groups of students but activities are not always adapted enough, particularly for the least able. There are insufficient opportunities for students to use information and communication technology (ICT) in lessons or to be innovative in their work.\nCurriculum provision and adaptation are acceptable overall. Teachers\u2019 planning is thorough. The curriculum in the KG does not ensure children\u2019s phonics skills are developed quickly enough.\nThe quality of protection, care, guidance and support is good overall. The school\u2019s systems and policies ensure the health, safety and care of children are good. Students are well cared for in school and are happy.\nLeadership and management are good.

Backed by a quality-assurance ISO 9001:2008 certificate, an international reputation and refined expertise, Liwa has become a trademark of academic excellence in the region.\nIn our books, education means much more than imparting facts and statistics. It means nurturing latent talents, fostering creativity and empowering students to form opinions, preferences, and interests to become critical thinkers, and lifelong learners.\nCommitted to continuous self-assessment, improvement and change, our educational philosophy highlights five key pillars:\nLearning by doing: This pillar provides students with unique opportunities to use their knowledge in real-life situations. It encourages them to take an active role in learning new skills, polishing them and building new ones through practical and experiential activities such as science experiments, surveys, and problem solving activities.\nHolistic Education: This pillar motivates students to develop a wholehearted approach to education by imparting a holistic approach for the mind, body and the soul. Thereby, making education a continuous learning process.\nGive Back What You Get: This pillar fosters authority among individuals, promotes gratitude and persuades them to play an active role in society. The main objective is to derive key takeaways from different people and cultures that inhabit our society and drive inter-dependency. Nurturing social skills and other initiatives are some of the main activities under this pillar.\nBe open-minded: This pillar motivates people to be open to new methods of learning and to be more aware of the opportunities beyond school and home. Educational trips, industrial visits and annual excursions further help in broadening these perspectives and opportunities.\nTake responsibility: This pillar encourages students to take responsibility for their own behavior and actions with respect to their environment at home or school. The pillar comprises student councils, special conferences and various leadership programs to build the will to make firm, practical and wise decisions among students.\nSummary of ADEK Inspection\nLiwa International School offers students a good level of education both academically and in their social development. The strong drive for improvement is evident through all layers of leadership; from the very experienced board of trustees, a principal with a clear vision for the school and an exceptionally determined newly formed senior leadership team (SLT) who have brought expertise and fresh insights. All students start school without any spoken English and with low literacy and communication skills. In Kindergarten (KG), they make at least good progress and this continues throughout the school. In the higher grades, teaching is stronger and prepares students very well for their next phase of education, training or employment. The very well maintained building and clear organizational structures allows the school day to run very smoothly.\nStudents are respectful and behaviour and attendance is very good, reflecting the impact of UAE culture, Islamic values and the caring ethos of the school\nSchool\u2019s Strengths\nThe improvement to the quality of teaching and learning, particularly in Arabic\nSchool leaders have a strong, cohesive sense of purpose and are making rapid change to establish best practice in modern leadership\nLeadership at all levels have clear understanding of the strengths and areas for improvement in all subjects and set high expectations\nInterpersonal relationships between all members of the school community are strong, contributing to the welcoming environment and positive ethos\nThe school promotes strong UAE culture and Islamic values which is evident across all aspects of school life, both academic and social\nThe care, guidance and support of all students is very strong, ensuring students and staff enjoy a very well maintained and organised school environment\nThe broad and balanced curriculum with strong cross-curricular links, augmented by good enrichment and extra-curricular opportunities.\n",

Achievement and provision in the Kindergarten have declined since the school\u2019s last inspection. The performance of current younger year groups is significantly weaker than examination results signify. In all but the high school phase, achievement in most subjects is weak. Provision and outcomes in Arabic are very weak. Teaching, learning and progress in Urdu are strong and standards are sometimes above average. The development of students\u2019 learning skills is exceptionally weak. The recent loss of about 20 staff, most of them teachers, has plunged the school into a crisis, affecting the quality of learning in most subjects across the school. It has impacted particularly adversely on the Kindergarten. A very weak aspect of teaching, which is limiting students\u2019 progress, is the almost total lack of guidance to students about how to improve their work. Students\u2019 personal development has declined because the school provides very weak care, guidance or support to promote acceptable development. Governance, leadership and management are very weak which results in inadequate aspects of health and safety, including safeguarding. The school is not licenced by ADEK and the principal designate has not yet been appointed formally. Analysis, self-evaluation and improvement planning are very weak and are inaccurate. Monitoring of teaching and other aspects of school performance, such as students\u2019 progress and behaviour are inadequate. As a consequence, the school does not have an accurate picture of how well it is doing.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe school\u2019s commitment to serving its local Pakistani community\nLearning and progress in Urdu\nAttainment in English and mathematics in grade 10 and above, particularly in examination results\nStudents\u2019 increasingly positive attitudes towards learning as they move up the school.\n",

Students from all ethnic, religious and cultural backgrounds shall have equal opportunities for excellent quality education. Students shall be guided to tolerate others who come from different ethnic, religious and cultural backgrounds and to show respect for their beliefs and practices. The school shall help promote national identity and values among learners.\nSummary of ADEK Inspection\nThe overall performance of the school is acceptable. The school has trebled in size since opening three years ago and the current principal is new in post. The senior leadership team (SLT) have a good understanding of the school\u2019s strengths and areas for development and the school self-evaluation plan is mainly accurate. The\nschool development plan is detailed and broadly matches the requirements for further school improvement. The most significant aims are related to some of the recommendations made in the previous inspection report.\nThe staff are caring of the students and relations are positive. The school has improved attendance significantly. Students enjoy coming to school and have positive attitudes to learning. Their behaviour is managed well, particularly in lessons when the quality of teaching is acceptable or better. There is some\ninconsistency in the quality of teaching across the school.\nChildren enter the school speaking little or no English. On entry to the kindergarten (KG), their basic skills are assessed and the large majority make expected progress in these as they proceed through the school. In primary and middle phases, internal assessments are undertaken at regular intervals during the school year. Students\u2019 class work is not marked regularly and the quality of marking is variable. The school has broadened the curriculum and a period a week is allocated to extracurricular activities. Students are safe at the school. The school started the current academic year with ten teachers short of the full\nstaffing complement.\nSchool\u2019s Strengths\nA clear sense of purpose and commitment to school improvement by senior leaders\nStudents\u2019 enthusiasm and positive work ethic\nStudents\u2019 responsible and positive behaviors\nStudents attendance which is 98%\nStudent-teacher relationships which are warm and caring\nStudents\u2019 respect for the culture and heritage of the UAE\n",

It is very good in mathematics in the high school, and good in other phases and throughout the school in science. Progress in English is good in the primary and middle phases and in Arabic in the KG and primary. Students\u2019 personal development is good. They have increasingly mature attitudes to learning although this is better for the older girls than the older boys. Teaching is good overall with only a minority of weak lessons. It is in these lessons that the more-able students are not always sufficiently challenged by the work they are set.

This represents an important turn around for the school. Students\u2019 positive behaviour and relationships are a strong feature of the school community, as is their appreciation of Islamic values and UAE culture and heritage.

We provide our students with an exceptional education, while nurturing the intricate behavioral/social aspects in their learning process. At Alia, we produce students who will respect others along with their choices, and live a healthy lifestyle. Our aim is to ensure that our students ultimately succeed in this ever-evolving and demanding world. We lay more than a foundation, we instill more than just an education; we make the Students of today, the Leaders of tomorrow.\nWe believe in placing the student at the centre of their own education and that learning is a life-long experience. Students are encouraged to take some responsibility for their own learning and to support others in their efforts. Our teachers lead by example and are reflective practitioners. We have an inclusive community approach to education. Students, teachers and parents are given the opportunity to play their part in the decision making processes at appropriate times.\nTogether as a learning community we will continue to set and achieve the high standards that are expected of us. We empower our students to exceed their potential and help them become responsible global citizens who understand and respect multicultural diversity. Our students actively learn from the experience of doing real tasks beyond the classroom. Students\u2019 involvement in our Extracurricular Activities (ECA) program increases as they progress through the Primary and Secondary schools. These personal development activities increase their self-awareness, help develop new skills and require them to engage with issues within our community. We promote a culture of self-awareness and personal development, and understand the importance of developing the whole person.\nAs a successful school we will never stand still; we will continually strive for excellence by monitoring and evaluating our progress so that we know exactly where we are and what we need to do to improve. We know that the quality of the teacher in the classroom is the most critical component in achieving academic excellence.\n\u2018The most important person in our school is the student. The most important asset is the teacher\u2019\nOur School\u2019s Philosophy and Mission Statement guide the understandings and skills we value and want students to demonstrate. It necessitates that in each class and in every lesson, students will develop a deep understanding of the key concepts in each learning area, in ways that respect differing styles of learning. Our curriculum sets out clear requirements, expectations and principles of learning and teaching. We expect our curriculum to generate excellence and equity in student learning outcomes, and provide opportunities for students to develop their intellectual tools and strategies, thus enabling them to think for themselves, and to manage their own learning.\nSummary of ADEK Inspection\nAlia International School provides education of weak quality. Student's attainment is below the expectations of the curriculum in English, mathematics and science at the primary and middle school phases. Attainment in Arabic and social studies is below the expectations of the Ministry of Education (MOE) curriculum at the middle school phase. Attainment in the kindergarten (KG) is in line with or higher than expectations of children of that age and they make at least acceptable progress in all subjects. The quality of the teaching is weak in about half the lessons at the primary and middle school phases. The curriculum is weak. As a result, students make less progress than they should in most subjects and in the development of important learning skills, particularly the ability to work independently of the teachers.\nThe school has undergone considerable instability since its opening in 2012. There have been several changes of principal and other senior staff in that period.

The senior leaders and governors have an accurate understanding of the school\u2019s strengths and areas for development. There is inconsistent practice in addressing the areas of development and consequently improving the quality of provision to required levels of standards.\nStandards of attainment in most subjects meet or are above the Ministry of Education (MoE) curriculum expectations. The trend of strong performance, in final MoE examinations, has been sustained in most subjects; standards in English have fallen. These standards of achievement were not observed in teaching and in students\u2019 work. The progress of majority of students in lessons and within different groups such as those with special educational needs (SEN) and those who are more able or are gifted and talented is weak. Students do not make the progress they are capable of in Islamic education, social studies, English, science and in other subjects outside of the core offer. Lessons lack challenge, demonstrate low expectations and utilise inappropriate strategies for meeting the needs of different students. In consequence, the overall quality of teaching is weak. The extensive assessment data collected is not used to effectively inform and change practice within the classroom. Feedback to students on how to improve is weak. The curriculum has not been effectively adapted to address the innovation agenda.\nThe school generally promotes a caring environment, relationships are courteous and supportive. Resources have improved but there are continuing constraints on student learning in physical education and creative subjects. The school has appropriate routines for its day-to-day management.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe direction and planning initiated by the principal and vice-principals to promote school objectives\nThe positive relationships and students show mutual respect for each other and their different cultural backgrounds\nBehaviour and positive attitudes to work shown by most students, particularly girls.\nThe attainment in almost all subjects, in comparison with MoE curriculum standards\nThe provision of a scheduled programme of professional development\nThe open communication with parents.\n",

We aspire to become one of the leading providers of state-of-the-art educational frameworks, using the latest modern technology and applied skills to create problem solvers, who are able to meet the challenges and opportunities of contemporary globalization.\nThis year, Future International Academy has adopted various educational strategies to impart practical experience to students and strike a balance between theoretical and practical teaching. The school has introduced iPads and various Apps. in class instruction so as to prepare students in their life journey, empowered with the necessary life skills to successfully cope with the demands of the twenty-first century.\nNew initiatives have been taken last year to enhance the students\u2019 learning environment and feeling of well- being. The school provides students with all the needed requirements to flourish, by supplying students with the latest technologies in STEM classes (Maker Space Rooms) and with the best reading resources in reading rooms organized all around the school. A period for English reading and one for Arabic reading have been allocated to students to take advantage of a wide variety of reading resources made available in hard copies and electronic copies.\nOne of our most significant accomplishments during the Year of Tolerance was successfully meeting the objective of eliminating bullying, to a large extent, among students by raising their awareness about the value of tolerance during Moral Education lessons, and their sense of responsibility toward their fellow mates in the school community during the morning assembly program.\nMonitoring patterns of students\u2019 attendance and punctuality levels has shown that there has been a significant improvement in school attendance and a decrease in the percentage of student absenteeism and lateness.

Professionals from the community take part in these workshops to educate students about different career aspects and how to make advantage of different opportunities in life moreover, the school arranges special trips for our high school students to attend career fairs and universities within and outside Al Ain city. As for grade 12 students in specific, the school provides the opportunity for early professional development before they graduate from school by organizing a real-life, vocational training program for Grade 12 students outside the classroom. In order to meet one of the graduation requirements for American curriculum schools, and get acquainted with their fields of interest. FIA students are assigned to be trained for one week in certain institutions/organizations inside Al Ain City, so as to explore the practical skills needed for the prospective career they plan to pursue in the future. The on-the-job work placement enables senior students to investigate the work demands, and inquire about the educational credentials needed to qualify for it.\nWe are so proud of the remarkable progress achieved this academic year on all levels compared with previous years, particularly in the school leadership and staffing. The most recent ADEK Inspection Report alludes to the fact that \u201c2017-2018 was a turbulent year for school leadership and staffing. There was a high turnover of staff (35%) and a new principal was appointed from April 2018. The school is now fully staffed. Changes to the school timetable, curriculum structure, staffing responsibilities and restructuring of KG have had a positive impact.\u201d (page 3, in ADEK Inspection Report 2018-2019).\nIt is worth mentioning here how proud we are of our students\u2019 growing number of achievements throughout the year, whilst participating in several scientific competitions and sports tournaments on a national scale, and have subsequently gained distinguished accomplishments and awards. For example, FIA students have won several gold medals and championship trophies for participating in the Jiu Jitsu, Taikwando, swimming and athletics competitions.\nThe school fosters the spirit of creativity and innovation. During the first semester, FIA students across all grade levels were encouraged to participate in the First Lego League Competition, held in Abu Dhabi, in which they won the best award in discovery and research. They were granted the distinguished title of \u201cSpecial Rising Stars\" as well! During the second semester, the upper grade students have achieved second place in the First STEM Competition, organized at Abu Dhabi University \u2013 Al Ain Campus. This year, FIA students were also nominated to compete on a national level in the \u201cThink Science\u201d Competition finals round, in which they have won third place in the category of transportation and road systems.\nWe are happy to provide you with all the new updates about our school; wishing you an enjoyable browsing experience.\nFuture International Academy is providing an exemplary learning environment in line with the vision of ADEK with under of Amercian Curriculum.\nAims:\nOur aims are directly in line with the aims of private education in the UAE as articulated by ADEK as follows:\nTo enable all children, male and female, to become confident, articulate, independent, enthusiastic and successful life-long learners\nTo engage children cognitively, experientially and emotionally by fostering their spiritual, social, cultural and moral development across the entire range of school provision\nTo provide a relevant, flexible and challenging curriculum that allows all students to complete secondary education, to have access to opportunities for further study, employment or training, and to become effective and successful participants in tDr. Shatha Al Ghazalihe local and international communities\nTo develop an understanding of UAE history, culture and language\nTo provide inclusive opportunities and special educational assistance to children with special needs\nTo provide opportunities and special programs for children who are gifted and talented\nTo recruit and retain teachers who are skilled, dedicated and highly qualified\nTo offer opportunities for parents to participate in the education of their children\nTo promote and enrich the national identity, family and community values, local traditions and cultures, and the pluralistic society of Abu Dhabi and the UAE\nTo provide life-long learning that that equips students with the core knowledge 21st century skills, critical thinking and life skills required to be competent in an everchanging world.\n",

From its inception to the present day, Ibn Khaldun School continued to grow and flourish to become one of the leading educational pioneers in the United Arab Emirates.\nIbn khaldounIslamic is an effective school that not only achieves high levels of achievement, but also mastering life skills related to their trends, gaining values, acting and moving away from different problems,troubles and issues, namely warm nursery and safe home for students from kindergarten to high.\nBased on the identity and pride of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the Ibn Khaldoun Islamic School has acquired its authentic Arab identity. It also stems from aspirations and deep faith in the Arab community of unity, which the school has instilled in its children generation after generation and urges the right Islamic commitment to all age groups.\nVision\nPreparing an educated generation that contributes effectively to the progress of the UAE with high aspirations\nActivate the role of the school as a comprehensive social institution working to raise the level of educational performance and instilling values of citizenship, responsibility and taking initiatives..\nThe school teaches the curriculum of the Ministry of Education in the United Arab Emirates, in addition to supporting some subjects with additional curricula such as English and computer\nThis decision was based on the following factors:\nThe Arabic identity of the school, which was adopted at the time of foundation.\nIt is the duty of the National and Educational School to support the national curricula of the UAE.\nAlmost, all of the school\"s students are Arabs who will continue their studies within the UAE or in their home-countriesl whose curricula conform to the curricula of the United Arab Emirates.\nGoals\nBuild a generation that believes in its Islamic and Arab identity, and strengthening the system of educational values in students\nEstablish positive attitudes in students\" behavior and to instill self-discipline and self-confidence\nStrengthen links between members of the school community and encourage teamwork\nImprove the educational level of students\nProvide Arab education that competes with the highest levels of international education\nSpread a culture of excellence in all areas of the school\"s work\nDevelop the professional competencies of the employees in the school and deepen the concept of scientific and practical research work\nExpand buildings and school facilities to meet the requirements of the educational process\nExpand the use of technology in education to implement e-learning\nConsolidate the relationship between parents and other relevant parties\nThe school seeks to achieve these main goals by harnessing all the human and material resources and following a systematic and well thought out plan that can be developed every year\nSummary of ADEK Inspection\nThe overall performance of Ibn Khaldoun Islamic Private School is weak. Attainment levels and progress are weak overall. They are acceptable in Islamic education and social studies. In the high school phase, achievement is acceptable in English, mathematics and science. Students\u2019 personal development and the quality of the care, protection, guidance and support they receive are acceptable.\nTeaching and assessment are weak. The majority of lessons do not enable students to make acceptable progress, especially the more able and those who find learning difficult. The curriculum does not meet the learning needs of most students.\nTeachers rarely use assessment data to plan lessons and track student progress. There are signs that more effective strategies are being used in a minority of lessons. Their impact on students\u2019 learning is too slow.\nThe principal is respected by staff and parents. He has played a pivotal role in addressing the recommendations from the previous inspection so that some improvements have been made. The impact of leadership at all levels on the quality of teaching and students\u2019 progress is limited.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe majority of students\u2019 willingness to learn, especially in the girls\u2019 section\nThe mainly positive relationships between students and teachers\nThe promotion of students\u2019 appreciation of Islamic values and the heritage and culture of the UAE\nThe ethos of the school, which ensures that students are safe and cared for.\n",

Sunflower School is founded on the belief that our students are individuals coming together with a common need for security and challenge in their learning environment. Our students are respected as individuals though more importantly as part of a productive, healthy and happy community. Our students are capable, creative, responsible and resilient people who come together to make a difference. We provide a school environment that fosters positive self esteem, mindfulness and encourages curiosity through engaging hands on learning to allow our student's  natural abilities, personality and talents are able to shine through.\nAt Sunflower we\u2026 \nWelcome to Sunflower School, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.  Sunflower School is founded on the belief that our students are individuals coming together with a common need for security and challenge in their learning environment. Our students are respected as individuals though more importantly as part of a productive, healthy and happy community. Our students are capable, creative, responsible and resilient people who come together to make a difference. We provide a school environment that fosters positive self esteem, mindfulness and encourages curiosity through engaging hands on learning to allow our student's  natural abilities, personality and talents are able to shine through.\nAt Sunflower we believe that a child\u2019s educational journey is a shared responsibility between students, staff and most importantly parents and we will work hard to develop and sustain these relationships. We therefore encourage and value the full support and involvement of parents in our community school.\nEstablished in September 2010 we are an English medium primary school with Arabic as a second language. The school is licensed under ADEK (Abu Dhabi Department of Education & Knowledge) as a Cambridge International Examination school.\nThe school offers the Early Years Foundation programme in KG1 and The Cambridge British curriculum to Primary aged children.\nWith our small class groups, wonderfully motivated and qualified teaching staff and active and enthusiastic parent support Sunflower School offers something unique to the Al Ain Community.\nThe mission of Sunflower School is to provide students with an integrated; child centered and age appropriate education which emphasizes both academic and social expectations for all students. SS will provide the opportunities, resources and environment necessary to encourage students to become lifelong learners. At Sunflower School we will teach the skills necessary to be productive, responsible citizens on the global stage. Sunflower School staff will give the support required to develop individual self worth and encourage students to become valued contributors and ethical decision makers in their future environments.\nSunflower School is a Cambridge International School using the Cambridge Primary Curriculum for core subjects - Numeracy, Literacy and Science. The International Primary Curriculum and other resources are used to support the delivery of other subjects like Geography, History, Art and Music.\nAlong side the Cambridge Primary Curriculum the school facilitates opportunities for health education, physical development and an Arabic language program taught both inside and outside the classroom. Our goal is to allow native speakers to retain and acquire the necessary skills to communicate in Arabic as well as giving non native speakers a legitimate opportunity to acquire Arabic as an additional language. All Muslim children are taught Islamic studies by a specialist teacher.\nSunflower School understands that their teaching staff are the heart of the school and the key to the success of our program. Therefore Sunflower School endeavors to create a rewarding and exciting workplace for our all of our staff where they are treated with equality and respect.\nSunflower School is a family friendly facility where parents and caregivers are actively encouraged to participate in their child\u2019s learning. The school can only survive and thrive with the commitment and support of its parent body. The ethos behind parental involvement is to create a community for the children where their teachers and families are valued and supported. It is the aim of Sunflower School to contribute something unique and worthwhile to the overall wider community of Al Ain city\nSummary of ADEK Inspection\nSunflower school provides a weak standard of education. In most subjects, students\u2019 attainment and progress are weak. In Islamic Education and Arabic for first language learners, attainment and progress are acceptable. The quality of teaching is weak in kindergarten (KG) classes and in the primary school for most subjects; teaching is good in only a few lessons throughout the school and assessment of students\u2019 progress is very weak. The school has a harmonious staff. There is a very positive ethos and it provides a nurturing environment so that students are willing and happy learners, although many are passive learners in lessons. The school provides acceptable care for the wellbeing, health and safety of its students. Parents are supportive of the school. The school has had a high turnover of staff since the last inspection. The current\nprincipal has been in post since September 2016.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe school provides a safe, secure, clean, and caring place for children\nChildren have strong interpersonal relationships and a thirst for learning\nOrganisational procedures of the school ensure that it runs smoothly on a day to day basis.\nRelationships at all levels in the school, including the relationship with parents are positive\n",

Our curriculum incorporates in its design numerous US educational platforms and resources that are differentiated and interactive. Additionally, students have access to thousands of interesting age and cultural appropriate books in Arabic, English and French on our electronic libraries.\nWe take a lot of pride in this establishment, because we believe that our investment in GIPA is a sacred one; an investment driven by our sense of responsibility towards our culture and community. We have made a commitment to our parents who have entrusted us with their children to spare no effort to develop our students\u2019 social tools and life skills that will ultimately assist them in dealing with everyday life.\nOne of the key attributes to GIPA is that it is a learning community dedicated to inspiring each student to achieve their dreams and to become a passionate lifelong learner prepared to adapt and contribute in a rapidly changing world. Since GIPA has the whole child development at mind and heart, we design our curriculum to meet all students\u2019 needs accommodating for all students\u2019 abilities, backgrounds and even gender.\n",

This is because the teaching in a large majority of lessons does not challenge students\u2019 thinking sufficiently nor does it equip them with the learning skills they need. The school leaders have been trying to tackle this issue for more than two years. They have developed a useful system for assessing their own strengths and weaknesses and they have been able to draw up a very detailed and comprehensive improvement plan which they review regularly. The targets in the plan are entirely relevant but the school does not have the capacity to ensure that change happens effectively, teaching and learning improve rapidly, and standards of achievement rise.\nThe school has provided training programmes for the teaching staff; these have not significantly improved learning and teaching. Staff turnover means that the school is therefore in the position of starting again with staff training. Where teaching is weak, and in a few lessons very weak, students are simply not engaged with the lesson. Typically in such lessons, the teacher explains something, the students write it down and then they go to a textbook to complete exercises. Rarely are they required to think, organise their own learning or write using their own words. In lessons it is rare to see the students critically thinking, problem solving or using information communication and technology (ICT) to help them in their learning. They are not gaining the skills necessary for life in the 21st century\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe students\u2019 understanding of Islamic values and their awareness of Emirati culture\nThe positive attitudes and responsible behaviour of students in the upper part of the school, particularly in the girls\u2019 section\nStudents\u2019 achievements in examinations in mathematics.\n",

Focusing on \"HANDS ON\" teaching methodology in the Foundation stage, students gain the necessary skills and knowledge by initiating and actively participating in the learning process.\nAt Pristine Private School every child matters. Here we strive to harness the individual potential and provide our students with the opportunity to learn and grow in a safe and comfortable environment that encourages inquisitiveness, responsiveness and respect for others. With our highly diverse student body, representing over 40 nationalities, from Foundation stage to Year 13, we are strongly focused on supporting our students to develop the right attitudes and competences to become successful global citizens of this ever changing world.\nIn line with our mission of producing compassionate global citizens, we practice selflessness and care towards self and others. Community Service is incorporated in the school system which effectively provides our students an opportunity to apply what they have learnt in the classroom to real human needs so that they can make a difference to the society. This not only helps to build a sense of responsibility in our students but also a sense of pride when they see what they've done is actually helping others.\nSummary of KHDA Inspection\nPristine Private School was inspected by DSIB from 16th to 19th January 2017. The overall quality of education provided by the school is good. The section below summarises the inspection findings for each of the six performance indicators described in the framework.\nAcross subjects, aspects of students\u2019 attainment and progress have improved, including Islamic education, and Arabic as a first and as an additional language. Learning skills are now very good in FS and post-16. Across the school, students are still developing deeper critical thinking abilities.\nStudents\u2019 personal development, understanding of Islamic culture and values, and social responsibility remain outstanding. Students have exemplary behaviour and are courteous and respectful to adults and each other.\nIn post-16, teaching is now very good, as it is in FS. The school\u2019s priority has been to improve teaching and this has resulted in greater consistency. However, improved teaching approaches still have to be consolidated in primary and secondary phases, where teaching remains good overall. Assessment processes are very good in FS and good across other phases.\nThe curriculum offers a well-balanced range of learning opportunities and choice of subjects, especially in FS where experiences are very stimulating and exciting. The school has improved curriculum adaptation to meet the needs of all students, more effectively, including those who are gifted and talented and those with SEND. The development of links to real-life and other curricular areas are sometimes missed in lessons.\nStudents are well supported to lead healthy lifestyles. They are cared for very well, and senior students are given very helpful advice to make choices about their future careers. Newly developed educational plans are helpful in identifying the areas where students with SEND can be better supported. Provision for students with SEND is now good.\nThe leadership structure has changed and improved in response to recommendations from the last inspection. This structure now provides for effective organisation of senior management responsibilities. Partnership with parents has strengthened and parents feel valued as part of the school community. Governors have a clear view of the school\u2019s quality of provision and support it effectively to address priorities and provide appropriate resources.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nHigh quality provision in FS, resulting in children's very good achievement.\nProgress of students across phases in English and science, and in post-16 in mathematics.\nStudents\u2019 exemplary behaviour and attitudes to their work, their understanding of Islamic values and Emirati culture, and awareness of personal and social responsibilities.\nThe school's attention to developing students' healthy lifestyles.\n",

Our values, Moral integrity, Ambition, Responsibility, and Kindness are the MARK of a Durham education and we develop these by immersing our students into the caring, supportive Durham community where every student\u2019s contribution is valued and potential is recognised.\nAt Durham, we appreciate that academic results and examination success are crucial to accessing the next stage of a student\u2019s educational journey and we take this aspect of your child\u2019s education very seriously. However, \u2018real\u2019 education is about so much more than this. It is our responsibility to develop successful, well-rounded, responsible and socially competent young people who will thrive in, and contribute to, the global community of the 21st century.\nIn pursuit of this aim, we are mindful that every child is an individual and that every educational journey is different. Every child is unique, they have their likes, dislikes, talents and personality. By getting to really know your child, we help them to develop the skills, self-esteem and confidence necessary for future success and thus produce thoughtful, happy, kind, well-rounded young men and women ready and prepared to make their MARK on the world \u2013 Mr Mark Atkins, Principal, Durham School Dubai.\nMessage from Durham UK\nWith a continuous presence here in Durham since 1414, Durham School established its international presence in Qatar in 2019 and then in Kenya in 2021: I am delighted that Durham School can now look forward to its branch school in Dubai joining the family of schools where happy children will learn to learn in a place where they feel safe and able to develop to their fullest potential.\nDurham School Dubai will share the same values, standards and overall ethos as have long since imbued our way of life here in Durham: we are wholly committed to operate our newest branch school such that it enjoys the same successes as we do here in Durham and so quickly establish its reputation as the best possible place for children to begin their educational journey in Dubai, and so develop their own \u2018Confidence for Life\u2019.\nDurham School Dubai will have a genuinely warm and inclusive pastoral structure where strong and supportive relationships between staff and students, and between students, is both expected and championed, and inspiring and caring staff work energetically and with mutual respect towards shared goals. Each student at Durham School Dubai will benefit from opportunities made available to them in the academic sphere, in sport, in cultural activities and in learning to lead.\nDurham School Dubai is well located in the Dubai Investments Park, it has wonderful facilities and will employ teachers passionate about their chosen profession and develop children in their care to their fullest potential; already proud of what a Durham School education provides in Qatar and Kenya as well as of course here in Durham, I look forward to seeing this same atmosphere of overall excellence becoming evident in Dubai \u2013 Mr Kieran McLaughlin, Headmaster, Durham School UK.\n",

We offer a fully inclusive curriculum, including an Enrichment programme which encourages development in sports, performing arts, outdoor education and service. We also have a pastoral system of four houses which offers a healthy sense of competition and leadership opportunities as well as a sense of belonging for all students, making the Academy environment feel much smaller and safer.\nOur most valued partnership is with our parents and students.

The overall quality of education provided by the school is very good. The section below summarises the inspection findings for each of the six performance indicators described in the framework.\nIn the Foundation Stage, attainment and progress are outstanding in English, mathematics and science. In primary and secondary, attainment is very good in all three subjects, and progress is generally very good and outstanding. In post-16, attainment and progress are variable across subjects. Attainment in Islamic education and Arabic is mostly acceptable with good progress in places. Students\u2019 learning skills are outstanding in FS and Post-16, and very good in primary and secondary.\nStudents\u2019 personal and social development is exceptional. Most students display excellent attitudes to work and they behave well around the school. In all phases, students\u2019 understanding of Islamic values and cultural diversity is outstanding for their age, as is their sense of social responsibility and environmental awareness.\nTeaching in FS is outstanding. Engaging activities ensure that children make a strong start to their education. Elsewhere, teaching is very good, although quality is not as consistent. Most teaching takes account of students\u2019 needs and offers appropriate challenge. In Islamic education and Arabic, teaching is more varied and sometimes progress is reduced. Across phases, assessment information is used well to track students\u2019 development.\nThe curriculum is rich and varied, and designed to develop a range of learning skills as well as knowledge and understanding. The school successfully modifies the curriculum to meet the needs of all groups, including those with SEND.\nStudents are very well cared for, and supported in their personal and academic development. They are safeguarded by a robust child protection policy and they respond well to the school\u2019s promotion of healthy lifestyles.\nLeaders set a clear vision and direction for the school\u2019s work. Leadership is widely devolved, promotes high standards, and focuses on raising students\u2019 performance. Sophisticated self-evaluation enables the leadership and the well-informed governors to identify and target the right areas for action in their improvement planning. Parents are firmly engaged with the school\u2019s work. Management is extremely efficient, and facilities and resources are of the highest quality.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nStudent\u2019s personal development and social responsibility are exemplary. Children in the Foundation Stage make an outstanding start.\nThe school provides very strong support for students with SEND, within a very caring and inclusive school environment.\nThe curriculum is varied and interesting, which enables students to develop strong learning skills.\nLeadership at all levels is strong, committed, and promotes innovative learning approaches.\n",

We nurture open-minded, principled, independent learners who exhibit self-awareness and grow to be responsible global citizens. We foster intercultural sensitivity and personal responsibility to encourage internationally minded young adults who are fully prepared for our future world.\nOur Belief\nEducation is a shared responsibility of the entire school community Board, Administration, Faculty, Students and Parents working in partnership. An orderly, safe and caring environment is essential to academic success and is marked by respect for the rights of others and the development of personal responsibility. Education must encompass the development of the whole individual with the school\u2019s emphasis on academic, physical, social and creative growth. That education must foster independent thinking, critical analysis, and appreciation and understanding of differences of opinion. All children do not learn in the same way; allowances must be made for differences in learning styles. All children must be recognized and valued for hard work and perseverance. The school experience must promote positive interpersonal relationships. Good education must instil a desire for lifelong learning. Information Technology must be an essential part of the school curriculum.\n",

Students have access to a broad range of learning experiences facilitated by a multicultural and multilingual international staff of educators.\nWithin our state-of-the-art, 21st century learning environment, each and every student participates in their educational journey as an active learner, embracing the opportunities and experiences facilitated by our multi-cultural, multi-lingual international staff of passionate educators. Our ethos is based upon the IB Learner Profile and GEMS Core Values, allowing us to develop international mindedness in all members of our school family \u2013 staff, students, and parents alike.\nAt GWA the Visual Art challenges students to consider authentic issues and develop their skills beyond superficiality and imitation. Students are provided with opportunities to function as artists, as well as learners of the Visual Art. To be an artist one has to be curious, and by developing curiosity about themselves, others and the world, students become effective learners, inquirers and creative problem solvers. In the Visual Arts students are guided to create and present art in ways that engage and convey their own feelings, experiences and ideas. Ongoing Reflection, along with self-assessment and peer-assessment, allows students to identify their progress and organize their learning for themselves.\nMYP Art values the process of creating artwork as much as the finished product; the two elements combined tell us what students have experienced, learned and attempted to convey. In this way, the educational value of any artwork is seen by placing it within the context of its creation. The artwork and the Process journal carry the same weight in the art class at GWA and they are both of equal importance. Each student\u2019s artistic process and thoughts are examined and assessed alongside their final artwork. At GWA the fine arts are studied at all levels; drawing, portraiture, painting, sculpture and print-making.\nIn 2018 GEMS World Academy introduced an exciting initiative, our \u2018Entrepreneurship and Leadership Centre\u2019.  Our team have created a continuum of Entrepreneurship curriculum which includes Careers and Business Skills being taught from Grades 3 up to Grade 12.\nThe goal is to establish a place where the attributes of entrepreneurship are enabled and developed.  We will host many workshops throughout the year, run by business leaders and experts who will also come in and assess student\u2019s start-up companies.\nTotal students registered Full Diploma candidates Diploma Courses candidates Number of candidates who successfully passed the Diploma\n114 93 19 92\nPercentage of candidates who achieved the Diploma Average points obtained by candidates who achieved the Diploma Highest Diploma points awarded to a candidate Average grade obtained by candidates who achieved the Diploma\n98.9% 33.1 44 5.30\nSummary of KHDA Inspection\nGEMS World Academy was inspected by DSIB from 15 to 18 January 2018. The overall quality of education provided by the school is very good. The section below summarises the inspection findings for each of the six performance indicators described in the framework.\nThe principal, with the full support of senior leaders and staff, is providing clear direction on the school's journey of continued improvement. Monitoring and evaluation are systematic and rigorous. Parents are closely involved in the life of the school. Governors have a very good knowledge of the school\u2019s performance. The excellent accommodation has been enhanced by a first class study lounge for senior students.\nAttainment and progress in the KG are outstanding and mostly very good in other phases. The apparent decline in mathematics and science in the PYP is a result of more accurate assessment. Attainment in Islamic education in the MYP has improved and is now good, as has attainment in Arabic as a first language in the DP, which is acceptable.\nStudents\u2019 behaviour is exemplary. They have exceptionally positive attitudes and take pride in their achievements. Most have a strong work ethic and participate in a wide range of environmental initiatives and charity events, drawing on their wellestablished innovative and entrepreneurial skills. While most understand the centrality of Islamic values to the culture of the UAE, for a few this is less secure.\nOutstanding teaching in the KG and PYP is based on teachers\u2019 deep understanding of how young students learn. Teaching in the MYP and DP has improved because more accurate assessment information is being used to match work to students\u2019 abilities and attainment levels. In a few lessons, the level of challenge is not high enough and critical thinking is not sufficiently developed.\nThe curriculum provides numerous opportunities for students to develop entrepreneurial and innovation skills. Older students are provided with a wide range of choices. Assessment information is used very effectively to adapt the curriculum to meet the learning needs of all groups of students. A wide range of extracurricular activities and educational visits enhance students\u2019 learning and provide memorable experiences.\nSystems for safeguarding students are extensive and highly effective. All staff are provided with appropriate training. Child protection and safeguarding policies are clear and understood by all. Students appreciate the guidance they receive on subject options, careers and university entrance. Provision and support for students with SEND is outstanding.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe inclusive nature of the school that ensures high quality care and support for all students, particularly those with special educational needs\nThe outstanding environment for learning in the Kindergarten and children\u2019s excellent attainment and progress in English, mathematics and science\nStudents\u2019 outstanding personal development and sense of social responsibility\nThe excellent arrangements for keeping students safe and promoting healthy life styles\nThe very effective use made of the excellent accommodation and resources to support learning, and the outstanding partnerships with parents.\n",

A focus on students personal development promotes positive attitudes to learning.\nWe offer an Islamic Academy to our students, up to 4 days a week in order to extend their skills in Quran recitation and memorization alongside with a reinforcement of the curriculum.\nWe ensure via a pedagogy coach, that our teachers are up to date with the latest innovation in teaching and learning and in line with the 2021 vision by Sheikh Mohamed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum.\nWe are laying the important foundations for successful language learning and we believe that teaching a foreign language makes a positive contribution to the Primary Curriculum. Children at RDS experience Arabic language from the Foundation Stage with formal lessons beginning in Year 1 with Arabic A (first language speakers) and Arabic B (second language speakers) lessons.  In all classes there are children with different language abilities, we recognize this fact and provide suitable learning opportunities for all children by matching the challenge of the task to the ability of the child.  Our goal is to foster an interest and enthusiasm for learning an additional language in a stimulating, enjoyable, fun learning environment where children actively take part.  From Year 3 we introduce the French language to our students to further advance this love of languages.  Our specialist teacher decides what level of input is appropriate and differentiate accordingly as learning a foreign language should be fun for all children.   Our fluent French speaking children act as helpers and are given extended tasks and more open-ended questions whilst students who have had no exposure to French may attend catch up sessions held outside the normal lesson time as part of our ECA provision. Learning a language opens up avenues of communication and exploration and promotes, encourages and instills a broader cultural understanding.\nThe study of a modern foreign language is increasingly important in a global economy and also has great value in terms of cultural and linguistic richness in our society, personal fulfilment, global citizenship and understanding. Through the study of a foreign language, pupils understand and appreciate different countries, cultures, people and communities and as they do so, begin to think of themselves of citizens of the world.\nOur languages department are confident with the full range of learning styles and ensure the learning is very active with a range of enjoyable activities such as the use of puppets, song, poems, rhymes, learning games, dance, listening, speaking, writing and reading activities and the integration of digital learning.\nSummary of KHDA Inspection\nGEMS Royal Dubai School was inspected by DSIB annually. The overall quality of education provided by the school has been judged as outstanding since 2015.\nIn order to judge the overall quality of education provided by the school, inspectors considered six key standards of performance. Inspectors looked at children\u2019s attainment and progress in key subjects, their learning skills and their personal and social development. They judged how effective teaching and the assessment of learning were across the school. Inspectors considered how well the school\u2019s curriculum, including activities inside and outside classrooms, met the educational needs of all children. They judged how well the school protected and supported children. In addition inspectors judged the effectiveness of leadership and governance, including management, staffing, facilities and resources. The inspection judgements were drawn from evidence gathered by the inspection team, including observing children learning in lessons, looking at their work, talking with children, meetings with the staff, parents and governors, and reviewing the parents\u2019, teachers\u2019 and senior students\u2019 surveys.\nOverall, GEMS Royal Dubai School provided an outstanding education for its students.\nChildren in Foundation Stage and students in the primary made outstanding progress in acquiring knowledge, understanding and skills in English, mathematics and science. Progress in Islamic education and Arabic was good.\nChildren at Foundation Stage had outstanding attainment in mathematics and science, and good attainment in English. Attainment in the primary phase ranged from acceptable in Arabic as a first language, to very good in science. Across both phases, learning skills were outstanding.\nStudents\u2019 personal development was excellent. They had very positive attitudes towards learning and to others. They were able to take responsibility for their own learning in a range of school, community or environmental projects. Their understanding of Emirati culture was exemplary. Knowledge and understanding of wider cultures, though positive, was less so.\nTeaching at the Foundation Stage encouraged children to capitalise on their curiosity and explore the world around them. The children benefited from an excellent range of motivating activities set up by teachers, who observed and recorded their progress in an outstanding way. Lessons in the primary stage were often of very good or outstanding quality, encouraging students to think for themselves. However, there was a degree of inconsistency across subjects in this regard. Assessment was done very well internally, but did not yet include regular external tests.\nThe curriculum was of outstanding quality. It promoted progression and continuity in learning and ensured that tasks and activities were well matched to the learning needs of different groups of students. Care and support for all students were of the highest quality, and students with special educational needs and disabilities benefited from targeted and customised support in their learning and personal development. Arrangements for health and safety, including child protection, were excellent.\nThe quality of leadership from the principal, senior team, and others was of the highest quality. Teamwork was a notable feature of the school. Stakeholders were committed to school self-evaluation and taking the school forward. Governors supported the school and that there was no letting up on the drive for improvement. They ensured that the school was appropriate resourced. Partnership with parents was highly developed.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nStudents were making rapid progress in acquiring knowledge and understanding in English, mathematics and science. They had exceptionally strong learning skills.\nStudents\u2019 attainment had improved in Arabic as an additional language and in Islamic education.\nStudents\u2019 personal and social development was excellent. They could take responsibility in a wide range of activities in and out of the classroom.\nStaff had created a very well planned and stimulating curriculum which, which along with teaching, was often inspiring. Rigorous assessment, was highly effective in promoting learning for all groups of students.\nAll staff ensured that students, including those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), were well protected and very well supported in their learning and personal development. There was an exceptional collegiate ethos among staff, parents and students.\nGovernors and the principal promoted teamwork very successfully. They, and staff at all levels, showed high quality leadership in driving the school forward.\n",

We promote the academic rigour of the UK National Curriculum of England within an inclusive family atmosphere. Situated in Dubai Science Park, Al Barsha South, Repton Al Barsha boasts state of the art facilitates that include science labs, art and design studios and impressive sports facilities.\nRepton Al Barsha is built upon the two strong pillars of academic excellence and pastoral care. We combine the traditional values of our partner school in the UK, Foremarke Hall, with the vibrancy of international life in the UAE. This enables our pupils to leave Repton Al Barsha fully prepared for the next phase in their education, whether in a UK independent school, an international school or a senior school here in Dubai.\nRepton Al Barsha School aims to produce happy, well rounded, well grounded young people who possess a thirst for learning; together with the confidence and skills needed to transition successfully to the senior school of their choice and life beyond.\nThis is achieved through the implementation of a curriculum that is broad and balanced and which retains core values whilst embracing modern philosophies where appropriate. Pupils are encouraged to challenge themselves in all areas of school life and beyond.\nStrong emphasis is placed on courtesy, manners and tolerance and pupils are encouraged to value themselves and others. Frequent assemblies, coupled with our excellent pastoral care system, help to ensure that Repton Al Barsha pupils develop an intuitive moral code.\nAlthough academic excellence is central to the Repton Al Barsha ethos, we are equally passionate in our belief that an all round education also needs to place importance on opportunities to participate in activities outside of the classroom. Sport is an integral feature of Repton Al Barsha life. Equally important is the focus on the creative arts.\nSummary of KHDA Inspection\nRepton Al Barsha School was inspected by DSIB from08to 10 January 2018. The overall quality of education provided by the school is very good. The section below summarises the inspection findings for each of the six performance indicators described in the framework.\nThe school is successful in delivering its core principles of aiming high, respect for all and enjoyment, whilst thriving in an international setting. Leaders, inspired by the headteacher, are very successful at improving many aspects of school performance. In partnership with parents and supported by effective governance, they are particularly successful in the creation of a culture of innovation within the school.\nStudents' attainment and progress, across both phases, continue to be predominantly very good or better in English, mathematics and science. In Islamic education and Arabic as an additional language, students make good progress from their frequently low starting points, to reach acceptable attainment. In Arabic as a first language, students make progress at acceptable levels. Students are developing strengths in independent learning and risk taking.\nIn line with the school mission, students have well developed self-discipline, are polite and respectful and show great resilience in their learning. Students in the primary phase have an improved knowledge and understanding of their local context from previous years. They are also extending their involvement in the local and wider communities, making good use of the potential of their technological tools and apps.\nThe quality of teaching continues to be very good in most subjects and across both phases. Learning is meticulously planned to engage students\u2019 curiosity and interest. Assessment of progress is on-going and often allows students choices of how to show their learning. In the primary phase, assessment information is utilised by teachers to adapt their planning to meet the individual needs of students.\nThe curriculum is regularly reviewed on the basis of students\u2019 performance. The curriculum builds on what students know and can do. Students can make connections between its different elements and with real life, making learning more meaningful. Links with Emirati culture and opportunities for students to develop entrepreneurial skills are improving.\nHigh levels of care and guidance ensure that students\u2019 good behaviour and well-being are sufficiently well-promoted. Students with SEND are welcomed into the school. Further training for all staff results in more accurate identification of students\u2019 needs. Improved individual education plans, give clearer guidance to class teachers and lead to students making good progress.

The overall quality of education provided by the school is acceptable. The section below summarises the inspection findings for each of the six performance indicators described in the framework.\nStudent achievement in Arabic and Islamic education is acceptable, except in Arabic as a first\nlanguage in the elementary school, where progress is good. Students have good achievement in\nscience in each phase. In English and mathematics, KG children have good achievement, but in other phases, achievement is mainly acceptable. KG children are enthusiastic, curious learners. Students' learning skills in elementary and middle phases are less strong, and are affected by below age-level reading skills.\nThe attitudes and behaviour of most students contributes to a positive learning environment. While some students do very well, there are exceptions where behaviour needs improvement. On the\nwhole, students understand the needs and differences of others and relate well to students from\ndifferent cultures. Understanding of Islamic values is outstanding across the school. Groups of\nstudents promote environmental understanding amongst their peers.\nSteps to improve the quality of teaching has had some success. Teachers work to adjust their teaching styles to the skills and practices required by the US curriculum. Efforts are being made in the development of assessment processes, and in better informing teachers, students and parents as to the progress, and next steps required, for each student.\nThe KG curriculum includes integration of subjects in an active learning environment. In the other phases, there is improvement in the implementation of the curriculum. Some cross curricular links take place, there are some aspects of the curriculum that allow student choice, and teachers are improving their adaptation of the curriculum for different learners.\nProvision for health and safety throughout the school is good. Teachers and students are aware of protection policies and procedures. The facilities are regularly maintained and kept safe. There are no elevators for students with disabilities, and temporary alternative arrangements are made. Attendance and punctuality is not consistently at the expected level. Students with special educational needs and disabilities have improved support this year.\nThe leadership of the school is strong, with clear direction and measured steps towards realistic goals set by the principal (Superintendent). The professional development and teacher evaluation systems match the school needs. Improvements towards having a well-qualified teaching faculty, proficient in English, are in process. Changes to SEND and KG staffing are benefiting student achievement.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe teaching of science is effective across all phases.\nThe KG learning environment supports good outcomes in children\u2019s achievements and personal\ndevelopment.\nThere are sound assessment systems in place and data is used to adjust curriculum and teaching.\nLeadership is clear and purposeful.\nGovernors are involved, informed and supportive.\n",

This means that the children find identity, meaning, and purpose in life through connections to the community of diverse cultures, to the natural world, and to humanitarian values.\nSMM draws out from its students reverence for life and passionate love of learning. First, children need to learn about themselves. This involves learning self-respect and self-esteem.\nSecond, children need to learn about relationships with others. This requires a focus on social \u201cliteracy\u201d (learning to see social influence) and emotional \u201cliteracy\u201d (learning to live responsibly in community with others).\nThird, children need to learn about resilience. This entails overcoming difficulties, facing challenges, and learning how to ensure long-term success.\nFourth, children need to learn about aesthetics. This encourages the student to see the beauty of what is around them and learn to have awe in life.\nSMM promotes transformative learning, making the world a better place for people to live in; views the various aspects of life as integrated and interconnected; advocates transdisciplinary inquiry; subscribes not only to continuous-learning but also to meta-learning; and recognizes community as the locus of learning.\nIn SMM, the teacher is viewed as a friend, as a mentor, as a facilitator, or as an experienced companion in the children\u2019s journey to life. Open and honest communication is expected and differences between people are respected and appreciated. Cooperation and collaboration are the norm.\nThe school mission to provide a high quality, value based education will be achieved by ensuring that the accountability for the standards within the school is distributed through a Senior and Middle Leadership Organisational Structure where responsibilities are clearly defined and a process of self-evaluation is transparent and rigorous.\nProfessional development (PD) is a critical component of the school\u2019s continuous improvement. The school\u2019s principal and senior leadership team will develop an annual PD Plan that ensures that all teachers have skills and knowledge required for effective teaching and learning, and to address specific goals of the school improvement plan.\nThe integral development and growth of every member of the Saint Mary\u2019s Catholic High School Muhaisnah Community underpin everything that takes place in the school, all of which makes up the school curriculum, the purpose of which is to develop independent, collaborative learners and responsible 21 st Century citizens.\nThe school curriculum comprises of all of the learning and other experiences that are planned for the students. The British National Curriculum forms one part of the school curriculum. The school is a community of learners where the uniqueness of every student is celebrated in line with the school mission to ensure academic excellence within a value-based, caring, family community.\nOur curriculum is designed to develop competencies, skills and values which will lead to deeper, more embedded knowledge that can be applied to produce independent, responsible global citizens who are prepared intellectually, emotionally and spiritually to face the challenges of the 21 st century.\nThe curriculum from Key Stage One to A Level will be developed based on the successful educational model at St. Marys Catholic High School Dubai, and will comply with all KHDA standards and requirements. St Marys Catholic High School in Dubai has developed its curriculum and standards based on the British National Curriculum and Edexcel standards.

We encourage our children to show these values in everyday interactions with each other as well as re-enforcing these values through the House system and through Key Stage assemblies. Our children are introduced to the Star Values in a child friendly manner through group discussions and roleplay.\nSummary of KHDA Inspection\nStar International School was inspected by DSIB from 14 to 16 November 2016 . The overall quality of education provided by the school is good. The section below summarises the inspection findings for each of the six performance indicators described in the framework.\nProgress and attainment in English, mathematics and science are good overall, and Foundation Stage children are making very good progress in English. Students\u2019 progress and attainment in Islamic education and Arabic are mainly acceptable. Students have well-developed learning skills in Foundation Stage and the primary and secondary phases.\nStudent\u2019s personal and social attributes are developing very well. At all phases, students show very good attitudes and behaviour. Their understanding of Islamic values and Emirati culture is well developed, particularly at the secondary phase. Students of all ages show age-appropriate understanding of environmental issues. Older ones take practical steps to help in the local and wider community, while children at Foundation Stage can work independently and help to keep their classrooms tidy.\nTeachers explain concepts and assess students\u2019 understanding effectively. At times, the quality of lessons is very good or even outstanding, but this is not consistently the case. Written feedback to students to help them improve the quality of their work is a positive feature.\nThe curriculum is well designed, offering continuity and progression in students\u2019 learning. It is adapted effectively to meet the needs of most groups of students. The curriculum in Foundation Stage, and the way in which it is adapted to meet the learning needs of different groups, is of very good quality.\nThe school\u2019s attention to promoting healthy lifestyles and ensuring that all students, staff and visitors are safe is outstanding. Yoga and meditation sessions contribute to students\u2019 wellbeing. Students benefit from good levels of care and support, and this aspect is very good at the Foundation Stage.\nThe school is well led. It has a good supply of resources and staff, and the premises are well maintained. Governance is good. Improvement planning is done systematically, as is self-evaluation, although the school\u2019s view of its own performance in a range of aspects is often too high. Partnerships with parents are of very good quality.\nSchool's strengths\nThe curriculum is well-planned and implemented, particularly at the Foundation Stage. Teaching and assessment feedback in English, mathematics and science, with some very good or outstanding practice, result in overall good attainment and progress in those subjects, and some very good outcomes.\nStudent\u2019s personal and social development is good or very good and, in some respects, outstanding.\nStaff implement the school\u2019s high-quality arrangements for promoting healthy lifestyles and ensuring that all are safe and protected in the school very well.\nThere is mutual benefit to parents and the school from the very good partnerships between them.\n",

Life at the College is defined by everyone feeling valued for who they uniquely are. We want our pupils to develop their talents to the full, in doing so they are expected to share those talents with a generosity of spirit and an enthusiasm to benefit others. Their success in excelling both in and out of the classroom is driven by our understanding of being a family school with a strong sense of community at our heart.\nWe provide a caring, supportive and tolerant community in which your son or daughter will thrive and love to learn, in which there are no stereotypes and where every achievement, however small, is noticed. From this we expect our pupils to have a love of learning for its own sake, which will lead them to excel in formal examination settings in later years at school and beyond.\n",

These feed into our house system, where the children are rewarded with house points for exemplifying the values of the school.\nLearning takes place everywhere: in the classroom, moving through the corridors, in the canteen, on educational trips, in assemblies\u2026 indeed the places are endless! Learning might be academic or understanding the social mechanisms that we have to learn in order to become well-rounded citizens.\nWithin Star International, we are proud to deliver a creative and skills-based approach to teaching, enriched in awe and wonder that incorporates the objectives associated with the British Curriculum. Our Curriculum is taught in such a way that we link children\u2019s learning to six themes across the entire year. This thematic approach helps to provide real-life context to children\u2019s learning; we call this our Concept-Curriculum. These themes not only help provide an excellent context to learning, but they also celebrate our international cultures both from a British perspective and an Emirati one too.\n",

Being fluent in English is not a requirement of entry to our EYFS or Year 1 classes and we regularly take children throughout the school where English is an additional language and not fluent.\nHorizon Communicator is the principle method of communication we use to share information with parents on general issues about the school or events involving children. There is a \u2018live\u2019 Horizon calendar plus links to our sports calendars, so that all stakeholders can check for events relating to the children.\nThe key areas are NEWS (short paragraphs of information), RESOURCES (where we upload letters, forms and trip information etc., for the school community to access) and ALERTS. Alerts are very short, important but not critical, messages when we need to alert you to something relevant. Alerts appear on your Communicator as a red pop-up, so that you don\u2019t miss them. For example, when students are away on trips, we publish daily news snippets (blogs) on what they are doing. From time to time we also publish pictures from events at the School in the GALLERY section (e.g. trips).\nAt Horizon School, the Music specialists are committed to excellence, energised by quality learning and integrity in teaching. They are passionate about the innovations that follow and how they strengthen curricular merit for all our children. Mr Malanga (the Head of Music) believes that the foundation for teaching is an understanding of learning.\n\"The past half-century of brain research has provided us with robust new understandings of the nature of music learning. At Horizon School we have taken advantage of this new knowledge to drive innovations in our teaching, assessment & differentiation. The results of these changes have been pride worthy. Students greatly enjoy their learning and are gaining practical musicianship skills that were once assumed to be the province only of the especially talented\".\nA wide variety of sporting opportunities are available at Horizon and we believe that physical activity is for everyone, from Foundation Stage One to Year Six. In our department we have five specialist teachers for PE and swimming who work hard to deliver an inclusive and inviting curriculum that challenges and inspires the children in every lesson. The boys and girls in our wonderful school also have the chance to learn and compete in 10 different sports in local and international tournaments and competitions, including football, netball, swimming, rugby and cricket (for both boys and girls).\nSummary of KHDA Inspection\nStudent's attainment and progress in English, mathematics and science are at least good and almost always very good. Attainment and progress in Islamic education and Arabic as a first and second language, remain overall acceptable. Students have very positive attitudes to learning. Student ability to be innovative and entrepreneurial is developing well in each phase of the school.\nAcross the school, students display outstanding personal development. They are self-reliant and\ndemonstrate self-discipline in a range of situations. Their understanding of Islamic values, their social responsibility and their innovation skills are outstanding.\nTeaching is very good in both phases. Throughout the school, systems of assessment are also very good, including how well assessment information is used to plan for the next steps in learning. However, in a few lessons, there is still some variability in this.\nThe school curriculum is broad and encompasses fully the revised National Curriculum in England. It provides students with a good range of subjects and extra activities. In the FS, the curriculum is outstanding and is modified to reflect the previous experiences of the children. Across the school, modification of the curriculum to meet the needs of students of different abilities is well embedded into lesson delivery.\nSystems for the protection, care and guidance of students are outstanding. The personal needs of students, including those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), are attended to very well within this inclusive school.\nInspiring leaders, together with a highly effective governance, have set a clear direction for the school, resulting in a number of improvements. Leaders are highly committed to the UAE priorities and to ensuring that the school applies an innovative approach in all its work, for example, the structure of leadership to learning within the classroom.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe school provides inspirational leadership and governance, and all staff demonstrate strong commitment to school improvement.\nStandards of achievement in English, mathematics and science are very good.\nStudents\u2019 attitudes and behaviour are excellent, resulting in a happy and purposeful learning environment.\nThe quality of learning skills and approaches to innovation are very good in each phase of the school.\nThe school has excellent relationships with parents, ensuring that they support and are fully involved in their children\u2019s education.\nThe school makes excellent arrangements for promoting healthy life styles and keeping all students safe.\n",

Co-education is followed from Kindergarten to Grade 4, with boys admitted only in these grades. It is a \u201cgirls only\u201d school from Grades 5 to 12.\nWe pride ourselves in offering an all-encompassing learning experience that molds our students into young adults who are achievers of the highest order in almost every field. In addition to unrivaled academic standards, we also encourage a healthy combination of sports and extra-curricular activities \u2013 providing a holistic education that prepares our students for life, as well as examinations. The School has been rated \u2018Very Good\u2019 by the DSIB for 5th consecutive year now.\nIt gives me great pleasure to look back on what has been an eventful, fast-moving and above all successful year for our students, teachers and schools. We should all take great pride in how we have collectively managed the ever-evolving nature of the past 12 months, for we have once more demonstrated our resilience, dynamism, positivity and togetherness.\nWith support and guidance from our regulators and the UAE authorities, our schools have continued to be lively, engaging and safe centres of learning and discovery, aided by technology and led by our passionate teachers and education leaders. Our students have once again been the standout performers, achieving record-breaking exam results, displaying their inventiveness and imagination at every turn, and demonstrating their boundless capacity and potential. There is no greater reward than to see them flourish.\nThe UAE\u2019s \u2018Year of the 50th\u2019 has also seen us participate in and contribute to landmark events including Expo 2020 Dubai and the country\u2019s Golden Jubilee. Our schools have embraced these as once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for learning and a chance for the young people in our care to have a hand in shaping the future of the nation and the wider world. It has been wonderful to see them contribute their inspired ideas and projects around sustainability, technology, mobility and wellbeing, and to see them make their mark on such a high-profile global stage.\n2021 has also seen GEMS launch TMRW, a major new EdTech product and platform that has the power to truly transform the education landscape for the better, opening doors for our students and ensuring no one is left behind. Every GEMS school is already hardwired into the TMRW ecosystem \u2013 in fact, many of you will already be familiar with keystone elements such as Phoenix Classroom \u2013 and as we further realise the potential of education in its fullest sense, our students will have access to ever greater learning opportunities.\nWe are also delighted to inform you that we will shortly be launching \u2018GEMS For Life\u2019, which delivers fully on our promise for lifelong guardianship of all our students through a suite of services that will support them throughout their lives in many, many different areas. The programme is now being finalised and will be fully launched in 2022, offering another great example of how GEMS Education takes care of our family of past, present and future students in ways that no other organisation can match.\nLooking to the year ahead, We are sure you share my hope for a steady continuation of our journey out of the pandemic. As ever, we will place our students and their families first, and my promise to you is that GEMS will continue to deliver the highest quality education for all, ensuring the academic, extra-curricular and personal progress and wellbeing of the bright young generations in our care.

We guide our students through Early Years Education all the way to the Cambridge International Examinations. Our preparation supports them throughout their lives, as students of the City School have the knowledge, understanding, skills and values necessary to prosper both in their future careers and in life. Along with academic rigour, our campuses broaden horizons with an enrichment programme that engenders social awareness, responsibility, innovation and creativity in equal measure.\nThe City School International now has schools in the UAE, the Philippines, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Its future plans include the establishment of further schools in the Arab states, South East Asia, and Africa.\nSummary of KHDA Inspection\nThe City School International Private School was inspected by DSIB from 7 to 9 November 2016 . The overall quality of education provided by the school is acceptable . The section below summarises the inspection findings for each of the six performance indicators described in the framework.\nStudent's attainment and progress are at least good and often very good in Islamic education, English, mathematics and science, in the primary and secondary phases. Attainment and progress in Arabic as a first and second language remains mainly acceptable but improvement is evident. In the FS, attainment and progress are acceptable in the core subjects. Students have positive attitudes to their learning. The ability to innovate and be enterprising is developing well, particularly in the secondary phase.\nStudents in the secondary phase are self-reliant, demonstrate self-discipline in a range of situations and have an outstanding understanding of Islamic values. In other phases, these features of personal development are not as strong.\nTeaching is good in most phases and subjects. The exception to this is in the FS where teachers are less able to manage the class and use learning time effectively, which slows children\u2019s progress. Throughout the school, systems of assessment, including how well information is used to plan next steps in learning, are variable in their effectiveness.\nThe school curriculum is broad and provides students with a good range of subjects and extra activities. In the FS, not enough attention has been given to how the curriculum should be modified to reflect the lack of prior school experience of most children. Throughout the school, modifications of the curriculum, to meet the needs of students of different ability, are not well enough embedded into lessons.\nSystems for the protection, care and guidance of students are good. The personal needs of students, including those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) are attended to well within this inclusive school. The quality of risk assessment, record keeping and the maintenance of school buildings and grounds requires development.\nLeaders and the governing board have set a clear direction and made appropriate plans for the school, which have resulted in a number of improvements. Leaders are committed to the UAE priorities and to the innovation agenda. They have not successfully tackled the barriers to improvement created by only one year of provision in the FS or improved the processes of self-evaluation. Leaders do not compare the school\u2019s effectiveness with that of other schools in Dubai or internationally.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nStudents make very good progress in mathematics, science and Islamic education, in secondary.\nThe personal development of students in secondary is at least very good: they have an outstanding understanding and appreciation of Islamic values and this has a positive impact on their attainment in Islamic education.\nStudents in secondary are provided with a rich and varied curriculum, which provides very good opportunities to extend their learning beyond the school and enables them to link learning across different subjects.\nStudent\u2019s ICT skills are very well developed. As a result, students are able to develop good research skills and make innovative use of technologies to extend their learning in a range of subjects.\n",

However, our enviable reputation stems from our consistent and sustained excellence in what we see as the four pillars of the College: sporting, creative, philanthropic as well as academic endeavour. We champion this broader holistic education in the great tradition of the British independent schools which recognize that by producing socially articulate and well-rounded students we are preparing them for their future far better than any exam ever will.\nWe are now the school of choice for parents who are well established within Dubai and the majority of families who choose the College are those who have lived and worked in the emirate for well over a decade. The reassuring sense of history and depth of institutional memory, which pervade the College, give the school a welcome stability within the Dubai educational landscape.\nWhen families join Dubai College they become lifelong members of an institution, which puts their child at the heart of everything of we do. Our not-for-profit status means that every dirham we charge is reinvested in the students and the school. The high quality teaching and excellent extra-curricular provision make Dubai College a very special place to be and we hope you can see why the College has earned itself an outstanding reputation since its establishment in 1978.\nBy the gracious consent of His Highness Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the Ruler of Dubai from 1958 until 1990, Dubai College was formally constituted on 4th May 1978 to provide, within the Emirate of Dubai, a modern secondary education in the British style, to the highest academic standards for those families who are on short or long term contracts, and for those UAE children whose parents wish them to experience this kind of education.\nBuilding on our founding mission, while recognising the responsibility we have for the future success of our students, the Senior Leadership Team, members of staff and the Board of Governors at Dubai College have an ambitious vision for the school in keeping with our heritage and growing global reputation:\nTo be leading British education overseas, underpinned by four pillars of sporting, creative, philanthropic and academic endeavour.\nOur relationship with key stakeholders will be critical in fulfilling our vision for the school and is set out below:\nDubai College aspires to maximise our students\u2019 potential both in the immediate and long-term future.\nDubai College aspires to involve parents fully and constructively in our students\u2019 education.\nDubai College aspires to be an employer of choice for both teachers and support staff by investing in our people.\nDubai College aspires to be a centre of excellence and thought leadership accessible to the community of Dubai.\nDubai College aspires to engage fully and collaboratively with both our local and international regulators as well as the professional bodies to which we belong.\nDubai College aspires to offer alumni lifelong membership of our community of excellence and to support them in their future endeavours.\nDubai College aspires to offer the very best of British education in order to serve and support British universities, organisations and employers within a globalised context.\nMembers of the Dubai College community are curious and open-minded individuals with a desire to learn and a cosmopolitan outlook. Parents, staff and students each recognise that commitment, hard work and resilience are the key qualities which have contributed to the school\u2019s success over time and are the same qualities which our students will need in order for them to succeed. As members of a community we work together, we like to be consulted and we like to co-create our school in harmonious synergy. This means that we are each committed to the highest standards of honesty and integrity and we respect ourselves and one another. We recognise that our students are driven, the world is their oyster and Dubai College exists to help them realise their ambitions. We believe these are admirable qualities and explain much of the success of Dubai College. And yet, our drive and ambitions must always make room for kindness, compassion and empathy. We are committed to the broader wellbeing of every member of the Dubai College community and we must remember that we are but one part of a much bigger picture. When we do these things we create a nurturing academic community which is second to none. Dubai College really does have a great feel about it and we are committed to this, our own tradition of excellence in education.\nSituated in the heart of the new Dubai district, the school\u2019s buildings and playing fields are extensive, covering some nineteen acres in total.\nIn addition to the light, airy and well-equipped classrooms, specialist facilities include a science block with twenty one laboratories, three design and technology suites, ten computer suites, four art studios, a canteen and a music centre with teaching and recital areas, twelve practice rooms and a recording studio. There are also three drama studios including a performance studio seating 150, a library, a dedicated Sixth Form Centre with 250 individual study bays and a state of the art 900 seat auditorium. The new Teaching and Learning Centre houses a 160 seat Lecture Theatre and space for collaborative learning allowing students to explore different methods of learning.\nThe extensive provision made for physical education reflects our belief in the contribution it makes to a well-rounded education. The SPACE (Sports and Performing Arts Centre of Excellence) houses a double width sports hall, a full size multi-use gym/fitness area, a swimming pool and 2 fitness studios. There are first class rugby, football and cricket pitches, cricket nets, four all-weather netball and tennis courts.\n",

H. Shaikh Rashid Al Maktoum Pakistani School-Dubai (English Lang) was inspected by DSIB from 26 to 29 October 2015. The overall quality of education provided by the school was found to be weak. In order to judge the overall quality of education provided by the school, inspectors considered six key standards of performance. Inspectors looked at children\u2019s attainment and progress in key subjects, their learning skills and their personal and social development.\nThey judged how effective teaching and the assessment of learning were across the school. Inspectors considered how well the school\u2019s curriculum, including activities inside and outside classrooms, met the educational needs of all children. They judged how well the school protected and supported children. In addition inspectors judged the effectiveness of leadership and governance, including management, staffing, facilities and resources. The inspection judgements were drawn from evidence gathered by the inspection team, including observing children learning in lessons, looking at their work, talking with children, meetings with the staff, parents and governors, and reviewing the parents\u2019, teachers\u2019 and senior students\u2019 surveys.\nThe school has four sections, which are: a. Kindergarten (KG), Primary, Secondary and High. Children aged four are admitted in KG1. All children seeking admission in any grade are required to appear in an entry test exam that is held by the school's admission committee. The schedule is announced in time so that the parents can make arrangement for their presence in the school with their children. The entry test is designed based on the concept the candidate seeking admission in a grade would have acquired the skills of the previous grade level. The test contains basic skills of the previous grade and the admission committee (AC) expects that the candidate will acquire 60% passing score. The qualified candidates are then interviewed by the AC members to ensure that the passing grade aligns with the knowledge of the candidate.\nCandidate who succeed in the admission process are offered admission and he or she is provided with all the necessary options and documentation checklist that is required for further process. The candidate may accept or reject the admission offer based on their situation. The qualified student can request for a seat in the school bus. The school bus does not always have the required seat, therefore denial of the request should be expected.\nThe School follows the National Curriculum of Pakistan along with Local Ministry of Education U.A.E. (Islam, Arabic & local social study books and syllabus prescribed by the local Ministry of Education). The curriculum encourages the students at all grade levels to develop a critical sense for wonder and curiosity about scientific, technological endeavors as well as to create social, communal and cultural responsibilities.\n",

As an academic institution, it is imperative that we receive support from our parent community and we look forward to work together to bring out the best in our children.\nNothing excites us more, than to witness the tiny, unsure toddlers entering our kindergarten metamorphose to young, confident men and women, who walk out of school, all set to take on the challenges that\u2019s thrown at them!\nWe, as a team promise to pursue a proactive and perspicuous approach to move the school to greater heights and unexplored vistas. We will make GMS a \u2018Happ(Y)ening\u2019 school!\n",

When children develop this skill, in a supportive and happy environment, it stays with them for life and they become lifelong learners enabling them to reach their full potential.\nAlthough we are situated in Dubai, and are very much a part of the local community and the great country that is the UAE, we never forget that we are a school which parents choose because of its \u2018Britishness\u2019.

We offer a learning environment where your child is engaged and cared for, where teaching excellence is paramount, and where students are set up to thrive.\nOur teachers are all experienced, native English speakers who leverage their experience and passion for teaching to create an exciting and rigorous learning environment for your child.\nWe never forget that your children are the most precious parts of your lives and that you have entrusted them to us, even with your concerns and fears about health and safety, particularly at this time. This is very humbling for us and we never forget the huge responsibility that this is, and we work tirelessly to repay this trust to you and your families.\nThe facilities at Capital School have been designed to offer a well-rounded experience for our students from Foundation Stage to Secondary School. From the spacious classrooms, library, outdoor space, two swimming pools, and sporting facilities, we\u2019ve developed a stimulating environment that will enhance learning and help your child thrive.\nThe needs of children today are changing at an extraordinarily fast rate; new challenges face them daily, and they need to be able to make sound, safe and well-informed decisions, as they make their way towards adulthood.\nThe issues that they face are complex and wide-ranging, and there is enormous pressure on them to succeed. At Capital, we recognise the importance of equipping our students with the tools to cope with difficult situations in later life. A focus on gratitude, kindness and reflection is a vital part of the strategy to support our students throughout the school, and to help them to become resilient.\n",

Our goal is to lead students to be confident individuals who are comfortable in taking risks but have the values to act with thoughtfulness and humility.\nThe Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), is the entry point of formal schooling at Dubai Scholars. This program sets the standards that promote teaching and learning to ensure children\u2019s school readiness. Our program gives children a broad range of knowledge and skills that provide the right foundation for good future progress through school and life.\nThe Primary School at Dubai Schools is a curriculum designed to enhance imaginative, diverse and creative learning for children within the robust academic environment we are known for. Outstanding teaching and learning opportunities are grounded in our delivery of the National Curriculum of England and Wales, an international British curriculum.\nLessons focusing student\u2019s personal learning targets are identified throughout the curriculum; assessment is both formative and summative allowing teachers to educate the entirety of a student\u2019s wide range of talents, curiosity and proclivities.\nSummary of KHDA Inspection\nDubai Scholars Private School was inspected by DSIB from 7 to 10 November 2016. The overall quality of education provided by the school is good. The section below summarises the inspection findings for each of the six performance indicators described in the framework.\nAttainment in English, mathematics and science is acceptable in the Foundation Stage (FS). Progress at FS is good in English and science and is acceptable in mathematics. Attainment and progress in primary are good across all subjects. At the secondary phase, both attainment and progress are outstanding in English and are very good in mathematics and science. They are good in Islamic education and acceptable in Arabic as an additional language. Students\u2019 learning skills are good in FS, primary and secondary and very good at post-16.\nStudents show outstanding behaviour, attitudes to learning and interaction with others. Children in FS have very good understanding of Islamic values and awareness of Emirati and world cultures. At Primary and FS, students and children\u2019s social skills and responsibilities are very good. They are outstanding at the secondary and post-16 phases. The school\u2019s developing innovation strategies enhance life-long learning skills.\nTeaching is consistently good. Most teachers construct lesson plans well and use assessment information to plan lessons. Assessment in FS is more effectively aligned to the curriculum to help teachers understand how to measure children\u2019s development and progress. However, across the school, teachers\u2019 ability to differentiate learning varies, resulting in students\u2019 needs not always being met.\nThe curriculum is good overall. An annual review ensures that planning supports progression in students\u2019 knowledge and skills. Extra-curricular activities are enriching, providing additional breadth and balance to students\u2018 learning. The performing arts are integrated very successfully, significantly enhancing the quality of students\u2019 learning.\nHealth and safety arrangements are good across the school. Staff ensure a safe and welcoming environment.\nTeachers\u2019 professional development is beginning to impact positively on the quality of teaching and learning. Staff morale is high. The principal is successfully extending leadership roles across the school, including enhancing students\u2019 responsibility. Governors are supportive of the school and relate well to staff, students and parents.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe very positive action taken by the school to improve the learning environment, teaching approaches and assessment at FS and the continued high quality teaching in the post -16 phase in mathematics and science in post -16.\nThe ability of students\u2019 in secondary to increasingly apply their literacy skills within the English subject curriculum and across other subjects.\nStudents\u2019 outstanding personal and social development. This includes their full participation in the performing arts, which permeates the work of the school, promoting inclusiveness, creativity, critical thinking and a sense of achievement and social responsibility.\nThe commitment of school leaders to the school\u2019s vision of developing tolerance and respect as a basis for academic achievement. This results in the enhanced roles and responsibilities of secondary and post-16 students, including their leadership roles in extra-curricular activities.\n",

We help our students to develop existing interests and to find new ones that will stay with them for life,\nHere at WIS our students are individuals with great potential, unique strengths and interests and we believe that it is our duty as a school to add value to each student by helping them achieve academic success and the joy of learning in an inclusive community in which all our students, parents and staff feel challenged, valued and successful.\nAs a fully inclusive international school, enabling a first class educational experience for students aged three to eighteen years, ensuring that all students are supported and challenged to achieve success is at the heart of all we provide at GEMS Wellington International School.\nWe recognise the uniqueness of each child through a programme of learning opportunities that promote challenge and personalised learning at all levels.\nHere at GEMS Wellington International School your child will experience an enabling, inclusive environment which will inspire them to achieve and succeed. We encourage creative and critical thinking within the context of meaningful real-life learning experiences. Our curriculum celebrates the diversity within our school and strives to create a nurturing environment with a strong, open and positive partnership between all stakeholders and the wider community.\nWe endeavour to equip our students with the values, attitudes and attributes required to become respectful, proactive citizens in an international community - respectful of themselves, each other and the world around them. In addition to academic excellence, our curriculum offers opportunities for our students to excel in leadership, sport, creative and performing arts.\n",

In all that we do, we place the needs of each of our students at the heart of our work. Hence, we have been successful in fostering academic excellence. We strive to develop the next generation of responsible global citizens, lifelong learners and innovative leaders.\nEducation is not merely acquirement of facts but also of values and skills which help us improve the different facets of mankind. It ensures that we leave the world a far better place than we found it. A pivotal role of education lies in shaping the personality of a child into a healthy mind and happy soul, who is not only equipped with 21st-century skills and aptitude required for academic excellence but helping him face the challenges of life in a balanced and harmonious way. Therefore, the system of education should work as a catalyst in making each child a balanced human being having his core strengths embedded in the learning experiences emanating from our rich socio-cultural roots.\nIn Gulf Indian High School, we enterprise to map the academic excellence with a good human value system, which in myriad ways is ingrained in the culture of the school. To achieve this, we strongly feel that a paradigm shift in the minds of all stake holders should take place so that when the school becomes the hub to initiate and formalise education it has its tenets enshrined in a good value system; the extension of which is thereby taken home where it is further strengthened. And our commitment to such education will always persist in all our endeavours.\nIn GIHS we believe in this principle and will never leave any stone unturned to see that all the innate potentials of the child are tapped to the fullest extent. In this pursuit of excellence, We appreciate our parent fraternity for supporting the school in every aspect. We also laud the relentless efforts of our teachers for giving their best in bringing out the best in each child. But we would exhort the students to be always modest, humble and disciplined while being ready to expand the horizons of their knowledge and skills by dreaming big and working hard.\nFired by a desire to light the lamp of education, Mr. John M. Thomas, the founder and chairman, started the school in 1979 with only 200 students and 35 teachers, the goal was crystal clear \u2013 we wanted to partner in the educational sector of Dubai by offering value-based education that will in turn contribute to the growth of this city.\nAn African proverb says, \u201cIt takes a village to raise a child\u201d. That simple statement, yet so profound in its wisdom is one of the cornerstones of Gulf Indian High School\u2019s (GIHS) ethos. Education is the key to UAE\u2019s future success in an increasingly globalized economy. With education emerge qualified human resources to turn the engines of the nation\u2019s prosperity.\nToday, we have grown over ten-fold in sheer numbers, supported by a sprawling 35,000 sq ft campus in Al Garhoud. We take pride in imparting values that will prepare the students for life. We aim to train children to develop an interest and love for learning.\nEven as we grew in size, the basic focus towards education has remained unchanged. We continue to be the \u2018big village\u2019 that raises \u2018every single child\u2019. As always, we remain committed to the all-round development of children. It is more than a commitment \u2013 it is our responsibility to parents and the society, to groom responsible global citizens, who can benefit from the opportunities while meeting the challenges of the modern world.\nWe will remain steadfast in our mission towards excellence and prepare our students for a bright future. It is our duty and we will honor it.\n",

Since its foundation in 1995, MAS aims to be recognized as one of the premier schools in U.A.E offering students quality education. The school aims to create a society of students dedicated to the love of learning and maintaining this throughout their lives.\nAs a parent I\u2019m quite aware of the challenges faced by many parents in selecting a good school that provides specialized care and balanced education for their children. As a principal I\u2019m in constant search for the causes that further the school\u2019s successes, allowing it to maintain its status and to continue to flourish. Such challenges played a major role in setting a high standard for quality education offered by the school.\nAt MAS we believe in educating for a lifetime. In addition to acquiring the universal academic skills, the school embraces a mix of the different teaching methodologies where the curriculum and activities emphasize a well-rounded approach that reflects our in-depth understanding of the child\u2019s needs and personality.\nThe school relocated to its newly purpose-built campus in September\u201909, with outstanding well equipped facilities. All resources and facilities have been put into use by professionally trained staff, together with our academic program yet warm school environment; students have the opportunity to develop as they progress in their pathway to learning, preparing them for adult life.\nA look at today\u2019s youth and children makes us see how they live in a fast-paced, changing world where social and technology pressures push them to grow up too fast. We believe that our role as educators is to redefine such pressures so that the essence of childhood is kept intact. Through our available resources and programs that address the intellect and emotions, children learn to recognize and control such influences and develop a perspective on the significant things in life. The school faculty works hard as a team nurturing the students\u2019 capabilities and combination of intelligence. Our emphasis not only lies in developing linguistic and scientific abilities, but creative and physical skills as well. Strengths and talents in other areas like sports, drama, music and art are greatly encouraged, providing a sense of adventure and challenge which children enjoy. The school is committed to and conducts special programs like Nature Appreciation, Character Development, Articulate Communication and Social Skills Training with emphasis on courtesy and etiquette. It is here where the classical values of integrity, respect and politeness are witnessed, governing our everyday interactions where adults and students show thought and respect for each other at all times. The school as well exposes children to experiences that teach taste acquisition and the development of style.\nDue to the fact that children need to feel competent, it is our responsibility to develop in them all the factors underlying their success in academics as well as in their personal lives. At MAS students realize and accept the fact that much of what happens to them is a direct result of their own initiative and effort, taking responsibility for their own actions. As a result students not only examine text passages but learn to examine their lives as well and are actively involved in the hardest task in the world: to think and to plan for self-improvement. Since one of our main objectives is nurturing in students the abilities to think and learn by themselves, making mental connections becomes our most crucial learning tool: the essence of human intelligence to become adept at solving problems. For the school to produce such a caliber of students, sitting in the classroom quietly, paying attention to the teacher and memorizing facts is not designed to bring out the desired qualities, but instead discovery learning opportunities that very much characterize the vibrant nature of this experimental-based and progressive school are emphasized.\nAt Mirdif, change is the end result of true learning at two levels: the student and the school.\nIt is here where the school is distinguished by its constant creation of educational forms, interesting ideas and unique opportunities that keep its system alive, adaptable and on the move, preaching novelty and individuality at all levels, yet at the same time clinging deeply to tradition and preserving the essence of the past.\nTo materialize such diverse methodology which is based on our unique educational philosophy, and maintain its active momentum, there is no substitute to strategizing, meticulous planning, setting our goals and reaching them.\nThank you for your interest in Mirdif American School. We look forward to working with your child to cultivate an appreciation of the past, its influence on the present and to bring out a sense of responsibility for the future. Such concern can be reached only with a worthy investment process in time and effort from both sides: the school and the home. In addition to the role of the home being traditionally known, what would be the role of a school, and what would be our duty as educators if not to inspire an enchanting mind, develop a captivating personality and offer an education that lingers on to last for a life-time.\nThe school is run by the principal who sets the long term goals of the school and devises strategies for attaining them. To achieve the common goal of the school, insuring not only the implementation of daily managerial procedures as well as school policies but providing supervisory support and actively participating in the decision-making and leadership process. This results in a daily working environment characterized by open communication, shared decision-making, shared accountability and professional improvement.\n",

It is our desire as educators to assist students to meet their fullest potential by nurturing the family values of warmth and care.\nTo ensure that The Sheffield Private School is the leading affordable British Curriculum school in Dubai.\nOur curriculum is based on the English National Curriculum where children are arranged into five Key Stages. The children aged 5 to 7 years old enter the Foundation Section and complete two years in Key Stage 1. These classes are referred to as FS1 & FS2 and they follow the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) curriculum.\nPrimary school aged children (Ages 7 to 11) start Key Stage 2 and complete 5 years in the Primary Sector (Years 1 \u2013 6) following a broad and balanced British curriculum.\nThe Secondary school phase begins for students at the age of 11 years old, this is known as Key Stage 3 (Years 7 to 9). Students again follow a broad and balanced curriculum which aims to hone their higher order thinking skills. At the end of year 9, students have the opportunity to choose the specific subjects they want to study alongside the mandatory Core subjects. They then prepare for the internationally recognised qualifications called the iGCSEs and BTECs. These qualifications are studied in Key Stage 4 (Years 10 and 11).\nThe pinnacle of a student\u2019s education comes in the Sixth Form where they choose which AS and A Levels or BTEC Diplomas they wish to study. Key Stage 5 lays down the foundation for further study at university, college, or entry into their career profession of choice.\nWhilst keeping the National Curriculum for England at the core, together with a fully inclusive admissions policy, we give national and expatriate students access to a unique and culturally relevant curriculum. In many ways, TSPS reflects the country we live in. We love the fact that our school has over 60 nationalities represented we a diverse, tolerant and welcoming school that is fully committed to the UAE National Agenda.\nIn addition to the taught curriculum, we enhance student learning through an enriching extra-curricular programme, which provides opportunity for every child to succeed \u2013 known as the Ultra-Curriculum.\nAs a school, TSPS subscribe to High Performance Learning, a pedagogy that requires teachers to instil in our students thinking skills and a growth mindset in an enquiry-based learning environment. The HPL philosophy sees all students as potential high performers who are not limited by ability. Some may take longer to reach high performance, but all are capable of this over time. High Performance Learning uses a unique teaching and learning framework to systematically grow minds and develop the cognitive skills, values, attitudes and attributes needed to reach success.

This is all while equipping them with a rich, connected bank of knowledge and skills relevant for the 21st-century.\nCitizens School has partnered with Blenheim Schools, part of the Chatsworth Schools group \u2013 one of the leading school groups in the UK \u2013 to provide an experience-based, inclusive curriculum bespoke to each child\u2019s strengths and approach to learning unique to Citizens School pupils named the Citizens\u2019 Tapestry.\nUsing the UK National Curriculum as its standard, the Citizens\u2019 Tapestry is a first-of-its-kind, custom-built curriculum that builds upon the blueprint with six key threads \u2013 Mindset; Entrepreneur; Health & Wellbeing; Sustainable Leadership; Global; and Digital Literacy \u2013 forming the pattern of its comprehensive, holistic, inclusive, and fun education system.\nThe Citizens\u2019 43,000-square-meter school campus, program and approach have been thoughtfully curated to re-shape learning, enabling students to thrive as citizens of the future, by focusing on wellbeing, imagination, and enabling outstanding outcomes for all young people. The groundbreaking Citizens School site is double the size of other schools in the same catchment area, has a capacity for 2,600 children between ages 3-18; a 2,900-square-meter open playing and recreation area; ample parking; a 1,250-square-meter multi-purpose performing arts and activity hall; six lane semi-covered swimming pool and learning pool, football and rugby pitches adhering to FIFA and World Rugby standards; as well as a dedicated dining area for primary school students.\nCitizens School is also the first in the Middle East education sector to accept cryptocurrencies for tuition fee payments. Children will learn about the importance of digital currency and blockchain technology, further preparing them for the future, in line with the UAE\u2019s ongoing measures to formalise virtual assets. The school will accept payments from the two major cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) \u2013 providing parents with flexible payment options. This is in addition to traditional forms of payments and interest-free monthly payment options that Citizens School will offer.\nKey Information\nStudents/Teacher ratio: 1:8 in Early Years Foundation Stage and 1:16 from Year 1 to 6.\nWe aim to keep the student to teacher ratio low to allow teachers to focus on each individual's strengths and weaknesses and tailor the learning experience according to their needs.\nMaximum class size: 24 students\nAge range: for the first year from 3 years old to 11 years old\nAccepting admissions from: September 2022\n",

We believe in placing the students at the centre of their own education and that learning is a life-long experience.\nOur effective partnership with parents contributes to the development of students\u2019 learning and we pride ourselves in our regular communication with parents through various learning platforms.\nWe follow an English National Curriculum model leading to the Cambridge Board IGCSE examinations in Year 11 and International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) and International Baccalaureate Career-related Programme (IBCP) in Year 12-13. Our external examination results are outstanding and notably above the world averages. Our graduates attend some of the best universities in the world.\nDIS is fully accredited by the COBIS, British Schools Overseas (BSO) and International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO). Our school is also a member of the British Schools in the Middle East (BSME) organisation and the Middle East IB Association (MEIBA).\nThe After-School Activities Programme helps children to build friendships with others who share the same interests. Furthermore, these activities can help them build character and learn important life skills, such as teamwork, commitment to tasks, conflict resolution, prepare for a successful career and improve overall performance.\nPerhaps one of the biggest advantages is that, depending on the type of after-school activity, they can foster creativity \u2013 an important factor in a child\u2019s education. For many students, recreational activities play a significant role in developing worthwhile hobbies and later on, potential career options.\nThe Library aims to provide a modern multimedia resource centre and a welcoming, inclusive learning environment which is central to the school, actively supporting teaching and learning within the school, recognising and valuing each individual as a lifelong learner, supporting the development of independent learning skills and fostering a love and enjoyment of reading in all its forms. We are committed to equality of access and aim to offer opportunities for all students to take responsibility for their own learning and recreation, effectively and with enjoyment.\nSummary of KHDA Inspection\nThe overall quality of education provided by the school is VERY GOOD. The section below summarises the inspection findings for each of the six performance indicators described in the framework.\nStudent\u2019s attainment and progress are mostly very good or outstanding. They are not as strong in Islamic education and Arabic, especially in the secondary and post-16 phases, where progress in Arabic is not better than acceptable. Almost all students are very keen to learn and work independently without constant teacher intervention.\nStudents\u2019 personal and social development continue to be a strength of the school. Students\u2019 attitudes to learning and their behaviour in and out of lessons are outstanding. Their understanding of Islamic values and social responsibilities towards others and the environment are consistently excellent.\nTeaching is often very good and in a minority of lessons outstanding. Almost all teachers have very good knowledge of their subjects. In all phases and most subjects teachers use a range of teaching strategies to engage students in learning. This is less consistent in Arabic lessons particularly in the secondary phase. Systems of assessment are outstanding.\nThe curriculum is designed to support progression in learning as students move through the school from Foundation Stage (FS) to Year 13. Careful consideration is given to adapting the curriculum to broaden students\u2019 knowledge and understanding of the UAE and to be successful in international tests.\nSecurity, health and child protection is given high priority and understood by everyone in the school. Throughout the school, staff show high levels of care and concern for their students. In the secondary and post-16 phases students are provided with excellent support in making choices for their future lives.\nThe experienced leadership team knows the school very well. Leaders are aspirational and continue to make improvements. Systems to evaluate the schools work are very good but the school use of the analysis of data to identify weaknesses requires further development. The work of the governing board and the engagement of parents make an outstanding contribution to school effectiveness. The management, staffing, and resources are of a high standard.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nConsistently outstanding progress in the FS in English, mathematics and science.\nOutstanding provision for health, safety, care and support of students, which results in their outstanding personal and social development.\nThe outstanding vision of the governing board delivered through excellent systems of assessment and day-to-day management, high quality facilities and resources and the full confidence and engagement of parents.\n",

All students should be encouraged on a daily basis to aim high and follow their dreams, with the notion that hard work is the key driver that enables outstanding academic performance. Equally importantly, we encourage our students to excel and participate in many different sporting, cultural and leadership opportunities. This enables them to develop their personalities and encourages them to be confident and happy individuals.\nWe place a huge emphasis on developing students\u2019 mindsets to encourage them to be positive, aspirational and resilient. It is important that they develop self-belief and confidence. The concept of international mindedness and the benefits of being a global lifelong learner are key attributes to achievement in an ever changing world. Education is about preparing students for jobs in 10 or 15 years that don\u2019t exist now. To do this, students need to be in a happy and safe environment. DIA works tirelessly to ensure that there is a strong ethos where kindness and respect prevail. These values then allow the students to become role models to each other and positive, well-grounded citizens who develop as future leaders.\n",

This makes an emphatic statement about the school\u2019s commitment to gearing students to navigate the information superhighway that is changing the world.\nEducation at PRIMUS transcends the confines of the classroom walls and pages of the text book. Our wide spread campus and facilities along with competent and committed staff all exude an air of warmth. \u201cLearning\u201d here is a joyous process where teachers, students and parents are partners at every step. Our School provides an ideal atmosphere for nurturing the talents and needs of young students. In planning the curriculum and putting it into practice, we aim to ensure that excellence is pursued and valued, that lessons are challenging and have pace and direction and the way children are taught, for example, individually, in group or as a part of whole class, matches their individual needs.\nOur Vision in imparting Education, is to mould, groom and transform our students in becoming future world citizens with Intellectual competence, spiritual maturity, physical and mental health and social acceptance, to enable them to become champions for the cause of justice, love, truth and peace and ever open to further growth.\nPrimus Private School facilitates comprehensive and integrated development of its students, to eventually grow as individuals imbued with righteousness and courage of conviction. We are dedicated to the individual development of attitudes, skills, knowledge and responsibility essential to successful achievement in school and society with a rich, child friendly, diverse and nurturing learning environment.\nThe school maintains a campus that is without fear. At Primus each student will have the right to information. With a strong awareness of rules and consequences, they are able to choose right conduct and act responsibly. This is a vital quality for each citizen in a democracy. The school provides an environment where students will evolve into fearless and responsible individuals. This stems from our belief that when self-esteem is inculcated in children at an early age, honesty and courage get ingrained into their character.\nAt Primus, the unequivocal benchmark for performance is excellence. Pursuit of excellence is an attitude that one carries all through life. This has to be cultivated from childhood. Be it academics or co-curricular activities, a small task or a large project, the hallmark of all at Primus is the passion for excellence. The staff and teachers at Primus lead by example.\nWe believe in free and frank discussions, listening to positive and negative feedback with equanimity and openness to problem solving. Only if an organization is built on the foundation of openness and approachability, can it evolve to higher levels of success and grow to meet the dynamic requirements of the rapidly changing world we live in. The management and staff at Primus follow an open door policy. Students or parents are welcome to walk right into the office of concerned staff member or management representative.\nIndividualism is a thing of the past. Individual excellence can transform into meaningful results only with teamwork. The importance of teamwork and collaboration is increasingly obvious in all walks of life. Emotional Intelligence and working in synergy with different people is an invaluable skill. The ability to share success and say \u201cWe Won\u201d goes hand-in-hand with the ability to take ownership of problems and say, \u201cI am responsible.\u201d\nThe most prominent difference between successful people and the others is discipline. It is not that successful people enjoy rules, it is just that they have achieved self-mastery to work within them. While freedom and fearlessness is encouraged at Primus, discipline is not negotiable. Every Primusian, students and staff, realize that each privilege and right available to them comes with a great responsibility.\nAt Primus we respect all religions and all cultures. No discrimination is permitted on the basis of religion, caste or even citizenship.\n",

There are two important developments here. The first is that parents will know that any surplus generated by their school fees will be put back into the school. The second is that working alongside an organization like Al Futtaim, we are uniquely positioned to provide real-world learning experiences to our students that other schools simply can not offer.\nUniversal American School is a wonderful place to grow and learn. Whether you want to participate in our Fringe Festival, one of our four annual school productions, watch one of our 30+ sports teams, debate politics with our Model United Nations students, or learn about our Emirati committee or the National Honor Society, UAS has something to offer everyone.

Student agency, voice, and choice are all components of our student-centered approach allowing our Secondary students to make an informed pathway choice either for our IB Diploma or our American high school and AP Capstone Diploma tracks. Universal American School embraces the very best of research-based American and international educational practices and fosters a culture of excellence. Our academic benchmarks are tailored to meet the aspirations of our international and Emirati student population.\nIn our vast and well-equipped Dubai Festival City campus, our teachers have always empowered students to become independent, creative, and responsible global citizens since Universal American School opened its doors in 2005. With our sixteen years of experience, we have taken an active part in the growth that defines our forward thinking cosmopolitan host city, Dubai. In this celebratory Year of the 50th, we as a school are inspired by the pioneering and entrepreneurial Emirati leaders whose bravery has placed the nation on the world stage.\nAt Universal American School, we follow suit and leap into the future while being rooted firmly in our core legacy. We believe that learning happens anywhere \u2013 and at any time! We have harnessed our experiences from a year and a half of successful distance learning, coupled with new learning technologies and digital literacy strategies, to ensure that we provide scope to co-construct and curate flexible and agile learning opportunities across all grade levels.\nThe power of our internationally-minded, experiential learning environment is enhanced by connecting and valuing the different contributions, skills, and talents of all our community members and strong ties with Al Futtaim Group.\nWe aim for our students to lead happy and healthy lives and to thrive in the forward-thinking, collaborative and engaging environment for excellence in learning that we offer.

It has indeed grown, in name and number. The students are offered a wide range of subjects from the Science, Commerce and Humanities streams. The primary section has progressed to a very competent senior school and as the vision continues to take flight, we now move on to greater heights.\nThe school\u2019s objective is best expressed through its mission statement of attempting to create competent, caring and confident students through its holistic based education. Our students actively support social issues like environment, literacy, relief and endeavor to become leaders in their own right. Such an all-rounded system of education has helped Diyafah produce an ever- increasing list of alumni who have gained admissions in several Universities in Canada, USA, Australia and the sub-continent.\nOur Mission\nWe are committed to a holistic based education in a caring and enlightened environment. We aim to foster creative thinking, courage of convictions and a positive attitude to draw out the highest potential in every student\u2019s mind, spirit and body.\nSummary of KHDA Inspection\nChildren in the Foundation Stage (FS) make good progress and reach acceptable standards in English, mathematics and science. Progress and attainment are good in these subjects in the primary school, very good in the secondary school, and at least good in Post-16. Attainment and progress in Islamic education and Arabic as a first language are acceptable. In Arabic as an additional language, attainment is weak and progress is acceptable. Students\u2019 learning skills are good across the school.\nStudents\u2019 personal and social development are strong in secondary and post-16, where their attitudes and behaviour are exemplary. Students\u2019 understanding of Islamic values is good in FS and primary, and outstanding in higher grades. Their social responsibility is very good in FS and primary, and outstanding in higher grades.\nTeachers demonstrate good subject knowledge in most subjects. In higher grades, teachers routinely involve students in problem-solving, independent research, and critical thinking. Lesson plans contain differentiated success criteria. This is most effective in FS, especially in literacy and numeracy activities. There are comprehensive assessment systems in place across the school. Data are analysed and used to inform teaching and curriculum review, although this is less effective in Islamic education and Arabic.\nThe curriculum is generally effective in supporting the development of students' knowledge, skills and understanding, particularly in the secondary and post-16 phases. Modifications made to the curriculum for different groups of students, especially those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), are also very effective.\nThe school pays close attention to students\u2019 health and safety. Relationships across the school are excellent. The well-maintained premises provide a very good learning environment. Students are well aware of safe and healthy life choices. Successful systems ensure very good attendance and punctuality. There are effective procedures and support for students with special educational needs and/or disabilities, and those who are gifted and talented. Care and support for all students is a high priority and of a high standard.\nLeadership is effective and has resulted in significant improvements to student outcomes. Improved self-evaluation provides school leaders and the governing board with a clear understanding of areas that require further improvement. Relationships with parents are excellent and partnerships with the wider community are a significant strength. The management, facilities and resources are of good quality.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe effective leadership of the principal and senior leaders promotes a shared commitment to ensuring all students do as well as they can.\nStudents\u2019 progress in English and mathematics in the secondary and post-16 phases is very good.\nThe personal and social development of students are outstanding in the secondary and post-16 phases.\nThe attention to ensuring students\u2019 health and safety, and the quality of support are outstanding\nPartnerships with parents and the wider community are outstanding.\n",

An emphasis is also placed on the teaching of the French Language which starts at the Kindergarten.\nIn addition to the academic offerings, the school puts a lot of emphasis on Extra-curricular and lesson-related activities. The school offers Arts and Music to all students starting from the KG levels up to grade 6. Grade 10 students take Visual Art as an Elective Course. Physical Education and swimming classes are offered to all grade levels.\nThe school is keen to prepare the students for the 21st century learning; all DIS staff provide students with the needed opportunity to gain the needed knowledge and master the required skills. All DIS students participate in co-curricular, extra-curricular, and cross-curricular activities. The school also plans for out-of- school activities throughout the year. Students are encouraged to take part in all events, national and international, as well as community and outer-community services.\nThe school allows for a wider range of activities and learning experiences through the varied and many clubs, which take place after the regular school hours and on Saturdays like Art Club, Music Club, Computer Club, Islamic Club, French Club, Robotics Club, Football Club, Basketball Club, Swimming Club, Karate Club, and Debate Club.\nWe are excited to tell you about our new venture that we are embarking on as a whole school which will involve teaching about society\u2019s core values. DIS core values were created with a few of our DIS -Al Garhoud- leaders who brainstormed a combination incorporating the KHDA values & internationally accepted values. Our values are right at the heart of what DIS is, driving what we do and how we do it. We have always prided ourselves on being a caring school with a positive atmosphere.\nValues education provides a structure for understanding civilized societies\u2019 values, so that everyone is clear about the way we should act and behave. By introducing Values education, we will be helping your children, our students, to better understand a range of basic society values. We are trying to create the atmosphere so our students take more responsibility to better prepare themselves for the global world of change within their future.\nValues education is not something entirely new for us, we have always worked in collaboration with parents and the whole school community, in teaching the children how to be responsible, make good choices and be the very best that they can be, ensuring they get the most out of every aspect of school life. We are sure that you will be pleased that your children will be thinking and learning about how to put these values into their lives, empowering them to take responsibilities and making the right choices to face whatever school and the wider world throws at them.\nWe will focus on one specific value each month and parents & students will be able to access the \u2018This Month\u2019s Value\u2019 newsletter on the website that you can share at home with your child. We appreciate all parents to also encourage the importance of values within our society to reinforce the importance within our global world. We hope that this will encourage our students to help their own community, family, friends, and ultimately take it with them to university and their future work environment. Please make sure you inform us, of things your child has done or said to demonstrate these learned values, so we can share it with our school.\nSummary of KHDA Inspection\nDubai International Private School was inspected by DSIB from 3/13/2017 to 3/16/2017. The overall quality of education provided by the school is acceptable. The section below summarises the inspection findings for each of the six performance indicators described in the framework.\nAttainment and progress are good in science in the elementary, middle and high phases, and in Arabic in the elementary and middle phases. Attainment and progress are also good in English in the Kindergarten and in Islamic education in the elementary phase. Although attainment in English is acceptable in the elementary, middle and high phases, progress is good. In other subjects and phases attainment and progress are acceptable.\nStudents\u2019 personal and social development is a strength of the school. Most students are well behaved and ready to learn when they arrive in school. They have a very good appreciation of Islamic values and a few are involved in projects that enable them to exercise initiative.\nThe quality of teaching and learning skills are acceptable in all phases. Teachers do not use assessment well enough. Work in lessons is often not sufficiently challenging and there is too little high quality teaching.\nThe curriculum has improved and is now good in all phases and there is some appropriate curriculum adaptation. However, although there is an understanding of the differing needs of students, there remains not enough modification to meet, consistently, the needs of the most and least able.\nThe school has adequate procedures for safeguarding students. The Kindergarten provides a safe and caring environment for children. Provision for students with SEND is good.\nLeadership is acceptable. Senior leaders have not been able to identify and improve the weaknesses evident in teaching. School self-evaluation is weak. Because most evaluations are too high, the school does not have an accurate picture of its strengths and areas where improvement is needed. Partnerships with parents and the wider community are good.\nGovernance is acceptable. Governors have provided additional resources to support school improvement. A lack of clarity in lines of accountability for school improvement planning makes it difficult for governors to hold leaders to account for students\u2019 outcomes. Day-to-day management and provision of resources are acceptable. However, whilst the school is adequately staffed, most teachers have limited prior experience of teaching the school\u2019s chosen curriculum.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe good attainment and progress in Islamic education in the elementary phase, in Arabic in the elementary and middle phases, and in science in the elementary, middle and high phases\nThe personal and social development of students, which is outstanding in the Kindergarten and very good in the other phases\nThe good links with parents and the wider community\nThe good provision for students with SEND\n",

When the port construction project was complete, the village was handed over to the Government of Dubai, but Jebel Ali Primary School retained its independent status and remained under the control of its Board of Governors.\nThe school's independent and non-profit status was cemented in 1986 by obtaining a Decree from His Highness Sheikh Maktoum Bin Rashid A1 Maktoum, the Ruler of Dubai. This was a major landmark in the school's history. The school evolved into an entirely British Curriculum establishment but never lost its desire to cater for children of all nationalities and abilities. Its multicultural and cosmopolitan profile is one of its most attractive features to this day.\nJAS is now located at a new state-of-the-art campus on Hessa Street, continuing the legacy of the original primary school, not only in this significant expansion of our facilities - enabling us to foster our pupils' growth from Foundation Stage through to Sixth Form but also in transforming our learning environment.\nEducation is however not a science with a simple equation leading to success and happiness - if only it were that simple. Attempting to develop and balance wellbeing resilience, social confidence, intellectual growth and philanthropy as well as interest and ability in the cultural and sporting spheres is not easy and certainly does not 'just happen'. However, if the student perseveres and is guided, supported and inspired by a specialist, caring and tremendously experienced team at school - as well as obviously, family and friends - then we are certainly nudging closer to that illusive 'equation'.\nOur classrooms are spacious and flexible, allowing us to fully utilise both inside and outside learning zones. Attention has been paid to ensuring that there is a sense of light and space in the school design. Our clustered designs around inner courtyards allow children in each age phase of the school to feel safe and secure in their own environment.\nIt is our mission to provide\nA safe, happy and welcoming organisation which has safeguarding and care at the heart of all it does\nAn embedded ethos of respect for others and themselves\nA multi-cultural learning community embracing a flexible and holistic approach that celebrates each child's unique talents\nAn enriched contemporary environment instilling independent and inquisitive learning skills\nA child-centred, innovative, inspiring curriculum\nAn education for pupils with the understanding that achievement is without limit\nwe aspire to continually progress and surpass expectation\nA sense of community that pervades all aspects of school life\nIt is our shared vision to\nNurture confident, reflective, emotionally intelligent learners\nEncourage critical thinking where pupils are willing to take risks and respond to challenges with enthusiasm and self-belief\nEmpower pupils to become resilient and adaptable lifelong learners\nPrepare our pupils to become responsible global citizens who lead healthy, active and balanced lifestyles\nBe the leaders of the future in our rapidly changing world\n",

While the provision of an international curriculum to a school population may facilitate achieving international standards, we believe that the opportunity to experience internationalism is not cultivated only by the curriculum but rather through the provision of an educational system and environment of international-mindedness.\nHence, as well as providing international education through US curricula, some of our schools follow a national curriculum which we modify and embed into our international-minded community providing these learners with exposure to and knowledge of a dual educational system.\nAt PPS-Dubai, the American High School program is on offer culminating with the American High School Diploma. The American curriculum is modified to include aspects of the local and international community. Advanced Placement (AP) courses are on offer in the Senior School. We believe it is crucial to implement aspects of the local and international community into everything that we do. We are driven by the U.A.E National Agenda to create a competitive edge and to compete academically on an international level while embracing and nurturing national values.\nWe focus on innovation and believe that students\u2019 opinions and contributions are principal to their learning and to the development of pilot ideas and programs at school. Students participate in activities that are enhanced by the cultural diversity of the host country, the school community and international contributions. We also believe that teaching openness, communication, respect, independence, and awareness are key to building international learners.\nAt PPS-Dubai, we believe that a person\u2019s success is not only measured by his or her academic achievement but also by strength of character. As such the school\u2019s administration and staff work to create a learning environment that empowers and encourages students to actively participate in social, economic, environmental and sports events both locally and internationally as well as promotes leadership in a community that is intercultural and international.\n",

We have already adapted to shed dead loads and make selective choices in creative learning environments, not just to survive but to thrive. This evolutionary shift has further enhanced digitalization, providing inspiration and encouragement to children, and enabling them to explore opportunities and solve problems independently. Sailing through these journeys are pathways of powerful learnings which are often driven by inquiry, passion, discipline, courage, and pivotally, a healthy dose of optimism.\nOur learners are allowed to upskill their inquisitiveness and exploratory approach by consistently tinkering with the unknown, self-regulating, and self-reflecting, primarily through experiential learning. We envision to create an agile and resilient learning culture where we stimulate professional fulfillment among the adults, share and transfer best practices, promote innovation, capitalize on diversity and multicultural perspectives, and employ evidenced-based teaching and learning strategies proven to improve student outcomes.\nWe believe that learning is a natural act that is unchanging, meaning its experiences will be different for all our learners. Our wider pedagogical repertoire enables us to create insightful learning environments acknowledging the unique abilities of our learners so that they are challenged, inspired, and guided to nurture their skills as they face the real world. We will continue to dedicate our effort into providing a world class education that revolves around collaboration and greater student engagement in every aspect of learning. We take every step to instill values of curiosity, intrinsic interest, perseverance, and risk-taking, creating a rich platform where character traits and leadership attributes are promoted amongst students and staff. We continue to focus on building teacher capacity to make the required improvements, engagement of students, and broader community support. We, as a \u2018Rahal School\u2019 aim to drive performance and build up accountability through improving the trust of our stakeholders and professional skills of our teachers, with an emphasis on \u201cNo child left behind\u201d.\nWe truly believe that instilling confidence is key to educational success, alongside inspiring students to be the best versions of themselves. In the last KHDA inspection, we have been rated \u2018Good\u2019 and above in 90% parameters. This helped elevate the school to an overall \u2018Good\u2019 rating and \u2018Developed\u2019 status during our KHDA Distance Learning Evaluation .\nParents, we applaud your involvement and contribution to our culture of expectations and enhancing the positive and ambitious climate of the school. Our collective engagement builds relational connections with teachers, classes, and the school, benefitting your child\u2019s learning, growth, and development while centering student success in school endeavors.

We envision to equip our learners with agency, a sense of purpose and the competencies they need to shape their own lives and contribute to the lives of others. As a CBSE affiliated school, we take pride in generating 100% Board exam results consecutively for the past 4 years, which is an outcome of individual attention we provide with a healthy student-teacher ratio.\nOur instructional design, pedagogy and assessment instill knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values required to thrive and shape a futuristic world. Dedicated to promoting values of innovative thinking, self-sufficiency, and global social awareness, TIAD helps students push the limits of what they can achieve by cultivating a passion for lifelong learning.

The overall quality of education provided by the school is acceptable. The section below summarises the inspection findings for each of the six performance indicators described in the framework.\nIn the Foundation Stage (FS), attainment and progress are good in English, mathematics and science. In primary, attainment and progress are acceptable, except in Arabic as a first language, where progress is good. In secondary, attainment is good in English, mathematics and science, and acceptable in Islamic education and Arabic. Progress is good in English, mathematics, science and Islamic education, and acceptable in Arabic. Students\u2019 learning skills are good in FS and secondary, and acceptable in primary.\nStudents\u2019 personal and social development is at least good across all phases, and continues to be a strength of the school. Students have good understanding of Islamic values, Emirati and world cultures. In secondary, personal development is very good and growing numbers of students demonstrate innovative thinking.\nThe quality of teaching for effective learning is good in FS and secondary, and acceptable in primary. Teachers\u2019 use of assessment to guide students\u2019 learning is good in FS where it enables the setting of tasks and activities well-matched to children\u2019s learning needs. These good features of teaching and assessment contribute to students\u2019 improving progress in the majority of key subjects.\nThe quality of curriculum design and adaptation is good in FS. Frequent and regular review and development ensures learning activities are well-matched to children\u2019s development needs. Curriculum adaptation is less effective in primary and secondary. Innovative extra-curricular activities in secondary, and project work in primary, increasingly helps students\u2019 develop independent learning skills.\nProtection, care, guidance and support is good in FS and acceptable in other phases. Arrangements to ensure health and safety, including safeguarding of students are adequate, with clear and comprehensive policies in place.\nSchool leaders have overseen improvement in aspects of teaching, assessment and students\u2019 attainment and progress. However, this is not yet consistent across all key subjects in all phases of the school. New governance arrangements need to establish clearer lines of accountability for school improvement. Parent partnership remains strong. Improved staffing and resourcing do not yet fully support new learning approaches.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nStudents make good progress in Islamic education in secondary, and in Arabic as a first language in primary. Students in FS and in secondary show good attainment and progress in English, mathematics and science.\nStudents demonstrate good learning skills in FS and secondary, and secondary students\u2019 personal development is very good.\nTeaching is good in FS and secondary, and assessment is good in FS.\nStudents\u2019 show strong awareness of UAE values and culture across the school.\n",

ASD continues to build on the rich and extensive history of more than 50 years to continuously improve the quality of the learning experience provided to 1,900 students.\nThe American School of Dubai, an independent, not-for-profit, US curriculum, international community school, offers what is best about American education to provide learning experiences designed to promote the maximum potential of its students.\nASD was established in 1966, before the founding of the United Arab Emirates, and is one of the oldest international schools in Dubai. Since that time, ASD has maintained its strong sense of community.\nThe American School of Dubai has a rich history, one that dates back to the very early years of Dubai. Founded by the Dubai Petroleum Company, the school has grown from merely a handful of students learning together in a small apartment in Deira, to nineteen hundred students learning together at our vibrant, state-of- the-art Al Barsha campus.\nStudent life and learning have evolved over the decades and ASD has continuously provided rigorous academic and extracurricular opportunities for every student. Although the American School of Dubai has grown and changed over a span of over fifty years, the spirit of community has remained a driving force behind the success of the school and its students.\n",

NAS offers an international curriculum that is based on American education standards alongside the UAE requirements of teaching Arabic language, Islamic studies and Social studies using the UAE national curriculum framework for those three particular subjects.\nSummary of KHDA Inspection\nNew Academy School was inspected by DSIB from 24th to 27th February 2020. Although the overall quality of education provided is acceptable, school has made remarkable gains compared to their 2017 report. The school has made improvements in 73 areas over three years with no performance indicator rated as \u2018weak\u2019. The areas improved in the last inspection were 46. The section below summarizes the inspection findings for each of the six performance indicators.\nAchievement across the school in Islamic education and Arabic is strong. In all key subjects, children\u2019s achievements in the Kindergarten (KG) are strong and continue to improve. High school students\u2019 attainment and progress are almost always good. Due to some weaker standards of teaching, including classroom management, achievement in the upper elementary and middle phases falls behind those seen elsewhere in the school.\nAcross the school, students\u2019 personal and social development, and their innovation skills are at least good. In both KG and the high school, these are very good. Students\u2019 understanding of Islamic values, and awareness of Emirati and world cultures, are very good in most sections of the school. The behavior and readiness for learning, of some students, in upper elementary and middle schools, are less than ideal.\nStandards of teaching are good across KG, elementary and the high school. Assessment systems are at least good, across most phases. The use of assessment information in Elementary is inconsistent. In elementary and middle schools, the quality of teaching is occasionally affected by low-level disruption by a few students, or by planning that does not take into account students\u2019 individual needs.\nThe curriculum and its adaptation for different groups of students continues to improve. It follows closely the required State standards. Programs and extra-curricular activities provide sufficient choice for students and promote interest and enjoyment. The curriculum is regularly reviewed by leaders who give consideration to the aspirations and needs of students, including students of determination.\nThe procedures in place for the health, safety and safeguarding of students are very strong. Managers undertake careful risk analyses and ensure that staff receive regular updates and training. Supervision is effective, including on school transport. Although some students admit that they do not always make the best lifestyle choices, the school considers the promotion of healthy eating and adequate exercise to be important.\nThis is a rapidly improving school, with many good and very good features, led by a highly knowledgeable and determined principal, with the highest of expectations. The principal is well supported by parents and increasingly strong governance. While self-review practices are systematic, and the school knows its areas for development well, evaluation judgements made by the school are too frequently inaccurate.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe very strong systems in place to ensure the safety and safeguarding of students\nEffective governance and supportive parents, accompanying the strong, senior leadership team is leading to rapid improvements in most aspects of the school\u2019s performance\nThe good standards of education across the high school\nThe good and improving education standards in the KG\nThe good, and improving, personal and social development and learning skills of students across the school.\nOur NAS community places emphasis on:\nAcademic excellence and intellectual curiosity\nUAE beliefs and culture\nTransparency Open-mindedness\nRespect and mutual understanding\nCaring Fairness\nHealthy living style and physical fitness\nIntegrity Reliability and collaboration\nEnvironmental awareness\nRespect and mutual understanding\nFreedom and Independency\nSelf-motivation and personal initiation\n",

Today, the SABIS\u00ae Network has an active presence in 20 countries on five continents and educates over 70,000 students.\nThe International School of Choueifat-DIP will be recognized as a provider of top-quality education to a highly diverse student body. ISC-DIP will strive to help all students achieve their full potential, prepare them for success in college, equip them with the ability and desire for lifelong learning, and strengthen their civic, ethical and moral values. ISC-DIP will maintain high standards of efficiency and accountability throughout its operation.\nAt ISC-DIP, we consider the school as a dynamic production team. Administrators, teachers, and students are all contributors to this team. Knowledge and ideas are the product of the team effort. Since students are the ones who benefit most directly from the product, they should be most concerned that the product is of a high quality.\nEveryone in a SABIS\u00ae Network school has a job to do; everyone is accountable. Administrators, students, and staff \"self-audit\" in order to discover and correct errors. It is teamwork that allows every team member to reach heights that would be more difficult to reach individually.\nLike all SABIS\u00ae Network schools around the world, ISC-DIP is a highly academic, non-selective, co-educational, English-medium, independent day school catering for the complete individual. ISC-DIP will graduate its first senior class at the end of the 2016-2017 academic year.\nISC-DIP provides top-quality education to children of different races, nationalities, and backgrounds.

The multicultural setting of the school helps students develop a better understanding of world cultures.\nThe curriculum implemented at ISC-DIP is specifically designed by SABIS\u00ae to provide students with the knowledge and skills needed to develop a solid academic foundation. This foundation will help students achieve their full potential and develop a love of lifelong learning.\nAll courses for students at all levels are clearly structured to enable students and teachers to know precisely what should be learned. Teachers teach one concept at a time using the SABIS Point System\u00ae with each lesson alternating frequently between oral work, individual work, and group work in such a way that it is difficult for students to \u201cswitch off.\u201d\nStudents engage in regular assessment using exams that teachers do not see in advance. Everyone in the school is accountable. Accordingly, students learn more in class and have more time for relaxation and fun after school.\nStudents who fall behind in their work are advised, motivated, helped, and coached until they catch up. As long as they manage their own time successfully, students' time is theirs, otherwise help is given.\nAll courses at ISC-DIP are structured. A system of academic tracking - the SABIS\u00ae AMS, a computerized method of detecting gaps in knowledge - allows the administration to closely follow the progress of each individual. Gaps are pinpointed as soon as they form, and efforts are focused on eliminating them. Valuable time is saved and a gap-free, cohesive structure of knowledge is built in students' minds.\nEmphasizing a well-balanced body of knowledge, skills, and experiences, the curriculum at ISC-DIP specifies daily learning goals at all grade levels. In an atmosphere that fosters the development of a lifelong love of learning, students learn how to study and are given the support they need to develop a solid academic foundation.\nStarting at Grade 1, our courses specify a minimum number of \"units of information\" that students need to learn. This minimum includes the simple concepts tested by the SABIS\u00ae AMS, as well as Basic Questions which test the material that \"everyone should know.\" In addition to this, ISC-DIP courses include extended material for more able students. Details can be provided to interested parents upon request.\nThe comprehensive SABIS\u00ae curriculum allows ISC-DIP students to achieve more with less effort. Each year, graduates from SABIS\u00ae Network schools around the world gain entry to highly competitive universities in the U.K., U.S.A., Canada, Europe, Australia, and the Middle and Far East. SABIS\u00ae Network schools pride themselves on the performance of their students at the most prestigious universities in the world including Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, Princeton, and Stanford to name a few.\n",

Today,1,025 children (501 boys and 524 girls) receive classes at the new school in Nthunduwala, and there are nine teachers who teach eight grades at the school.\nbuildOn has begun working with the community of Nthunduwala to identify 'out of school' children in the village and enroll them in primary school classes with anticipation that enrollment will exceed its current amount by the beginning of the 2021 school year. Additionally, buildOn will work with the community and partners at the local Ministry of Education to add additional grade levels and classrooms as they are needed. The entire community has not only reported increased morale of the students and parents of the community, but they have expressed their excitement for a vastly improved working environment for teachers. Most significantly, community members are overjoyed that students will no longer have to hold classes on the ground or in a structure that is unsuitable for learning.\nAll of our teaching staff are extremely well qualified with relevant UK experience and are selected for their abilities to create a motivational environment. Energetic and innovative, our team of teachers have a proven track record of motivating students to progress and work to their best levels.\nOur on-going programme of professional development ensures that our teachers are up to date with the latest teaching methodologies.

The section below summarises the inspection findings for each of the six performance indicators described in the framework.\nChildren in Maternelle achieve particularly well in language and mathematics. Across the school, students achieve well in most subjects, especially in English, French and mathematics. Achievement in Arabic as an additional language is not as strong.\nStudents are very self-disciplined. They moderate their behaviour and attitudes maturely and engage with peers and adults positively. They appreciate their lives within the context of the UAE and Dubai and understand many aspects of the local culture. However, they do not clearly demonstrate the skills needed to be innovative, entrepreneurial and creative.\nTeaching is an improving aspect of the school. Teachers know their students well and provide stimulating learning experiences in many areas. However, teachers do not consistently ensure that students have sufficient opportunities for higher order and critical thinking. There is an effective system of internal and external assessment, linked closely to the standards of the French curriculum. However, this does not measure students\u2019 progress from individual starting points nor does it facilitate comparisons with other schools in Dubai and internationally.\nThe French curriculum provides broad learning experiences through an internationally based academic programme that equips students effectively as global citizens. The adaptation of the curriculum to meet the needs of all groups of students has improved but is still inconsistent.\nEmergency evacuation procedures are not efficient enough and in need of review. Positive steps are being taken to provide appropriately for students with special educational needs. New SEND coordinators are beginning to establish systematic processes, including accurate identification, planning that includes parental and student input, and consistent implementation and assessment in lessons. These practices are not consistent across subjects and phases.\nSelf-evaluation has improved as a result of strong communication and collegial relationships. School leaders are developing teachers\u2019 understanding of how to improve students\u2019 achievement but the implementation of this is inconsistent. Governors understand the capacity of the senior leadership team and hold leaders to account through a long-term strategy for positive and sustainable improvement.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nSchool leaders know the school well and this has resulted in better self-evaluation. Teaching has improved as a consequence of direct intervention.\nStudents attain very well in most subjects, especially in English. Students\u2019 achievement in Arabic as a first language has improved significantly.\nGovernors have responded very effectively to previous recommendations, in particular by ensuring smaller class sizes in Maternelle, hiring specialised teachers for students with SEND, and developing the campus.\nStudents across the school display excellent behaviour and attitudes to their learning.\n",

This is apparent in the atmosphere, with students immersed in spiritual fervour. Being committed to excellence, our ethos enables holistic development of our children in an inclusive and caring environment. It is a growth mindset that enables all our pupils to achieve their true potential.\nOur target is to ensure meaningful learning outcomes through international best practices, using innovative teaching pedagogy. This involves promoting innovation and enquiry in students, coupled with an optimum focus on their personal, social and emotional development.\nIt is our earnest endeavour to motivate every student to develop the need, and the desire to seek, to constantly modernise and to reach newer heights; every day, every moment.

Students have a respect for religious and moral values and to develop non-discriminatory attitudes and practices which will enable them to live in harmony with all members of society. Students understand, care for and respect the world in which they live and the interdependence of individuals, families, groups and nations. Students appreciate human achievements and aspirations.

Students are encouraged to read from a very early age and regular book reviews are the norm.\nMSB also subscribes to myON, an online library of age-appropriate, themed texts.

Do browse our photo gallery to get a better perspective on the unique diversity and enthusiastic student life that exists in our school.\nThe land on which St. Mary\u2019s Catholic High School, Dubai stands is the kind courtesy of then dynamic Ruler, His Highness Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum. Under the guidance, determination and foresight of the founding father, Father Eusebius Daveri, St. Mary\u2019s Catholic School was born in 1968, in a little classroom, with 30 students and a handful of teachers. On 15th August 1968, Feast of the Assumption of Our Lady, Father Bamba, an Army Chaplain, in the presence of Father Eusebius and the community blessed the foundation stone for the school project. The school was ready for the next academic year. Children were enrolled and the number of teachers increased. Mrs. Lucy Hoadley, an Irish Catholic lady, was the first Headmistress.\nIn 1970, the right wing of the school building was completed. Expansion and growth was clearly evident. The standard of the school was raised to High School and in 1971 was recognised as a Centre for the London University GCE Examinations at Ordinary Levels. Mrs. Julia Thomas the then Headmistress worked very hard in achieving this goal.\nAs the school was expanding rapidly, Father Eusebius was promised nuns to help him in the running of the school. Each year the number of applicants increased. The excellent results of the O Level exams encouraged Father Eusebius to start the Advanced Level Classes. Under the guidance of the British Council, on 15th August 1976, on the Feast of the Assumption of Our Lady, for the third time, the foundation stone for the Laboratory and four Advanced Level classrooms was blessed.\n1972 summoned another change in administration. Sheila Mukerji was appointed as the new headmistress, and the curriculum broadened. For the first time, Physics and Chemistry were offered at O Level.\n1977 saw the winds of change with the arrival of the Combini Sisters \u2013 Sister Daniella, followed by Sister Fosca, Sister Mariangela, Sister Idangela and Sister Eliana in 1978. The baton of responsibility was passed into the able and dynamic hands of Sister Fosca Berardi, who was already working in the field of education. The school grew in leaps and bounds, ensuring high levels of academic achievement for the students. St. Mary\u2019s Catholic High School, Dubai was a renowned institution not just in the Middle East but worldwide.\nBy 1988, 20 years after the opening of the school, there were 1942 students on roll and 85 staff.144 students sat for their GCE \u2018O\u2019 Levels and 108 for their \u2018A\u2019 Levels. As a result of the high academic standards set, the Dubai Municipality honoured St. Mary\u2019s with the \u2018Best School\u2019, award, and London University selected it to set the standard for the GCE examination grades. The hard work of both students and teachers were reflected through the results. This has always been the hallmark of the school.\n1993, the Silver Jubilee Year, with 2200 students on roll, a staff of 92 and a glowing reputation of high academic standards, St. Mary\u2019s Catholic High School had much to be proud of and thankful for.\nSister Beatrice G. Mariotti, a young, modern and charismatic Comboni Sister took over the reign as headmistress of this great institution in 2001, until 2005 when Sister Annemarie Quigg took over. During her tenure the school saw a lot of modernization as well as confronting the challenges of the Dubai Schools Inspection Bureau.\nThe Patrician Brothers, the present torchbearers of a legendary institution like St. Mary\u2019s Catholic High School took over the responsibility of this great legacy in September 2013. At the helm we have Brother Joseph M. Joseph, supported by Brother Paul.\nWe pray that this great institution continues to be blessed with the source of light and knowledge molding the tender minds and lives of the students entrusted to it into Global Citizens. We continue to endeavor to develop every student\u2019s spiritual, intellectual, emotional, physical and artistic potential. We strive to develop and produce independent, critical thinkers who are responsible global citizens, capable of leading productive and meaningful lives.\n",

The GIVE Foundation is committed to bringing our community together to provide ongoing support to specific causes identified by our students.\nAt Innoventures Education the most important thing we do for our children is to help them develop values and skills that they can rely on throughout their lives. This includes contributing to international and local communities. The students of Innoventures Education have chosen the GIVE Foundation focus to be on providing access to clean drinking water and education in the less developed parts of the world.\nMillions of children around the world need help to break the never-ending cycle of poverty. Hunger weakens them. Unsafe drinking water makes them sick. Missing out on an education keeps them from reaching their potential. According to UNESCO (2012) 61 million children are out of school at the primary level, and 71 million at the lower secondary level. Water is not confined to political borders, 85% of the world population lives in the driest half of the planet. Each individual deserves to have access to clean drinking water. According to UNESCO, 783 million people do not have access to clean water and almost 2.5 billion do not have access to adequate sanitation. The organisations that the GIVE Foundation works with are Dubai Cares and Build On. Since the founding of GIVE, students across all the Innoventures Education schools have raised funds which have been used to build three schools, with a fourth one in the planning stages, in Nepal.\nPADIA is the Parent Association of DIA-Al Barsha. It is a group of volunteer DIAB parents who come together, in order to manage events and services for the school community. The group comprises committees which meet on alternate Mondays after drop off, and any DIAB parent is welcome to join PADIA and volunteer their time.PADIA has a core group of volunteers who meet regularly and provide the group\u2019s leadership. The core group also runs the school\u2019s second hand uniform and bookshop. Additional volunteers help with events and fundraisers as required.

We are pleased to be a student-centric organization, aiming at building generations with outstanding interpersonal and academic skills to keep pace with all local and international changes by instilling leadership, responsibility, social, moral and Muslim values in our students to excel and compete locally and internationally.\nAt New World Private School, we always strive to implement the world\u2019s best practices in the educational field, to enhance our students\u2019 talents and develop their skills, to strengthen the students\u2019 educational and cultural level, and to instill in them the patriotic, social and Islamic principles.\nOur committed and skilled teachers and staff are always working around the clock to support and guide the students and enhance their skills to improve their level of attainment which will ultimately lead to their success.\nWe are committed to communicate with you, for the benefit of your children, to implement new initiatives and plans that will have its positive impact on your children\u2019s education, and to support our students to aim high in their studies the same way we aim at reaching the highest standards in what we do.\nNew World Private School offers a range of extra-curricular activities, during the after school program, as part of the school\u2019s plan to empower its students and increase their attainment level.\nThe main goal of these activities is to enrich the knowledge and educational level of the students, and to strengthen their talents to create a gifted, skilled generation.\nSummary of KHDA Inspection\nStudents\u2019 attainment and progress are mostly acceptable across all core subjects. However in all these subjects, girls perform significantly better than boys. In English, mathematics and science, students perform considerably better in assessments based on the UAE Ministry of Education (MoE) curriculum than they do in international benchmark assessments, in which they achieve poorly. The quality of students\u2019 learning skills is acceptable.\nStudents have positive and responsible attitudes to learning and benefit from positive relationships. Attendance, punctuality and behaviour have improved since the previous inspection. Students have a good understanding of the role and values of Islam, and they enjoy participating in Emirati customs. They are beginning to develop an awareness of environmental issues and their potential impact on their lives.\nThe quality of teaching and assessment is acceptable across the school. Most teachers plan adequately for their lessons, but they do not adapt their approaches and expectations to meet the learning needs of different groups of students. Data are analysed to give a picture of outcomes and trends in students\u2019 attainment, but they are not used well to adapt teaching and the curriculum to improve student outcomes.\nThe curriculum meets statutory requirements and is adequately broad and balanced. However, the school\u2019s understanding of effective implementation strategies requires further development. Most teachers do not modify the curriculum to meet the different needs of their students in their lessons. As a result, the needs of some groups of students, including boys, those who have SEND and those who need more challenging work, are not effectively met.\nThe provision for health and safety has improved across the school and is now good. Staff and students have a good understanding of safeguarding procedures. Most risks are assessed and addressed around the premises. The monitoring of attendance, punctuality and behaviour have improved. Although identification of SEND has improved, the quality of support for students with SEND in lessons is still variable.\nLeaders have yet to articulate and share a clear understanding of what good quality provision looks like. They know the school\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, but plans to address the weaknesses are not yet effective. Communication with parents is good, but they are not yet engaged as partners in their children\u2019s learning. Governors have a well-informed understanding of the work of the school. However not enough teachers have appropriate backgrounds or experience to model good or better practice to others.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nGovernor\u2019s support and commitment to improving the school has resulted in a steady improvement over the past two years.\nStudents\u2019 personal and social development has improved and their good levels of understanding of Islamic values across the school has been maintained.\nThe provision for students\u2019 health and safety has significantly improved in all phases.\n",

Videotapes, audio cassettes, multimedia projector, smart board, overhead projector, document camera and educational CD-ROM\u2019s are available in a well-equipped multimedia centre.\nQueen International School has well maintained biology lab for practical sessions in accordance with the IGCSE curriculum. The lab is spacious and offer modern and excellent equipment where our students are encouraged to use their analytical and creative skills through research and experimentation. Apart from the Middle and Secondary School, students of the Primary School also have regular laboratory sessions.\nQueen International School follows the British Syllabus, preparing children for the London Board Examinations at IGCSE and GCE AS Level. The medium of instruction is English. The School follows the EYFS for beginners, Cambridge Primary from Grade 1 to Grade 6, Cambridge Lower Secondary Programme from Grade 7 to Grade 9, eventually preparing the students for the IGCSE in Grade 10,11 & 12 and subsequently, for the GCE AS examinations from the University of Cambridge examination.\nSummary of KHDA Inspection\nQueen International School was inspected by DSIB from 13 to 16 February 2017. The overall quality of education provided by the school is good . The section below summarises the inspection findings for each of the six performance indicators described in the framework.\nStudent\u2019s progress and attainment in all key subjects is at least good in the primary and secondary phases. In secondary, mathematics attainment and progress, and science attainment are outstanding. Across the school, students\u2019 learning skills are good.\nStudent\u2019s personal and social development, particularly their sense of personal responsibility and their understanding of Islamic values and awareness of Emirati and world cultures, is good or better across the phases. In KG, students understanding of Islamic values is outstanding.\nThe quality of teaching is good across the school. The majority of teachers apply their subject knowledge effectively to enable students to make good or better progress in lessons. Assessment is acceptable in KG and good in the other phases. The school benchmarks students\u2019 academic outcomes against external national and international expectations. Assessment data is analysed and used to adjust the curriculum and teaching.\nThe design, implementation and adaptation of the curriculum across the phases are acceptable. The curriculum is generally broad and balanced. However, there is no systematic review of quality, coherence and progression. Most teachers plan to adapt the curriculum to meet students\u2019 needs but this is inconsistently implemented.\nThe provision for the health, safety, care and support of students has improved and is now acceptable across the school. The school environment is generally safe and secure, although records of incidents are not used to identify recurring issues. The school promotes a healthy lifestyle for students. However, there is no systematic school wide approach.\nLeaders at all levels are committed to, and engaged in, improving students\u2019 outcomes. Leadership is distributed to heads of department, but there are no clearly defined roles for the leadership of teaching, learning, assessment and curriculum. The appointment of governors by the principal / owner is not conducive to their role in holding leaders to account. Self-evaluation and development planning, partnership with parents and the local community and management, staffing facilities and resources are all acceptable.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nStudents have attained outstanding results in IGCSE over the last three years in English, mathematics and science.\nAttainment and progress are generally good or better.\nStudent\u2019s personal and social development are strong, particularly their sense of personal responsibility and understanding of Islamic values.\nThe quality of teaching and learning across the school is good.\n",

Attainment and progress in Russian language is a strength, ranging from good to outstanding. Overall, attainment and progress in English, mathematics and science remain consistently good, although achievement in primary mathematics is very good, as is progress beyond the Kindergarten. Students' learning skills are at least good except in secondary where they are very good.\nStudent's very good personal responsibility in middle and secondary are matched by very good community and environmental awareness in secondary.

This continues to prepare most students well for the next stage of their education, training or employment.\nProvision for health and safety and students' care and support remain good. Access to the school is well-supervised. Transport arrangements work well and there are effective arrangements to monitor students' well-being. Advice and guidance for students is timely and well-considered.\nSenior leaders provide very clear direction to staff to guide the school's continuing improvement. Students, parents and staff share the school's vision in preparing its diverse, but cohesive student body for life beyond school. Governors support the school well. As last year, governors remain well-placed to develop their role in monitoring more closely the work of the school. Some self-evaluation judgements still remain too generous.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nChildren's and students' good to outstanding attainment and progress in Russian language, good to very good attainment in mathematics, across all phases of the school, and their good attainment, and or progress in the majority of other key subjects; and students' very good learning skills in secondary.\nStudent's good and very good personal development across the school especially in the secondary, including their good understanding of Islamic values and Emirati culture in all phases of the school.\nVery good teaching for effective learning in the secondary phase which complements student's very good learning skills.\nSenior leadership team's consistent focus on improving outcomes for learners in this school's multinational and inclusive community.\n",

The table below will provide you with initial guidance and we will be to expand upon these during your tour and as part of Parents Information at induction.\nWe want students to learn by doing, \u2018hands-on\u2019, through play, interaction, and collaboration with each other and with their teachers. Learning is student-centered and inquiry-led. Teachers facilitate learning and lead students into experience and present them with \u2018why\u2019, \u2018how\u2019 and \u2018what if\u2019 Questions which may have more than one answer or inquiry pathway.\nWe want our students to grow and develop in a safe and stimulating environment, where they are listened to and supported, whatever their needs and abilities. We want our students to embrace challenge, to understand what they \u2018can do,\u2019 to know clearly what their next steps are to reach their objectives.\nWe want to motivate them and for them to persevere when facing difficulties. We teach that mistakes are opportunities to learn better. We spend time ensuring that misconceptions are revealed and gaps in understanding closed. We encourage our students to assess their own learning and the learning of others collaboratively. We develop questioning, encouraging students to probe deeper, checking their understanding and opening up new pathways for inquiry. We want our students to be confident about sharing their learning, being creative in the use language and communication to explain, to persuade and take pride in their efforts. We believe that it is our role as teachers to design and reveal learning opportunities, to promote and celebrate discovery, to foster a love of learning that endures throughout life\nDigital learning and innovation are important tools that support teaching and learning and also enable to support students\u2019 learning at home. This allows us to ensure learning is creative through using age appropriate apps and games. It also allows parents to see first-hand how our teachers interact with their children and also communicate with parents, so that \u2018home-learning\u2019 (rather than homework) is always a task to be enjoyed and not a chore.\nThrough making the learning journey at GPS, parents will feel confident that their children will not only learn to achieve their own personalized, age-appropriate outcome objectives, following a curriculum that is both broad and deep, but that our teachers will track their performance closely against international benchmarks approved by the KHDA, identifying gaps and designing interventions to close them.\nWe also want our students to voice their own understanding and perspectives with growing confidence and certainty. We also want their learning to be underpinned by a set of learner attitudes and attributes that will make a positive difference to the world they will inherit. The development of character as well as personality is also critical to this purpose.\nIn addition to academic education, we seek to focus on physical, moral and personal, social and emotional development. Holistic education of the whole child develops Mind, Body and Spirit to be in harmonious balance. Mindfulness will be a feature of students preparing for each day of inquiry and reflection, of being in the right frame of mind to embrace the learning opportunities and challenges they will meet on their learning journey.\nAt GPS, our values and learner attributes underpin our Code of Behavior. These are integrated into the curriculum and are reinforced in the daily life of the school through the care and example displayed by our teachers and support staff. We expect parents to help us embed these values through an active partnership with us in supporting their child\u2019s education, not only academically, but in terms of their child\u2019s personal development.\nThis statement is already evolving. It is our mission to provide:\nAn embedded ethos of compassion through respect for others and for oneself.\nAn enriched curriculum with skills for life that transcend culture and gives access to all.\nAn internationally-minded learning community that celebrates diversity and personal achievement.\nA safe, friendly positive environment where wellbeing is at the heart of what we do.\nA flexible 21st-century learning space that accommodates \u2018bricks and clicks\u2019 Integrated approaches to learning.\nOpportunities for students to become effective, enthusiastic, independent and collaborative life-long learners.\n",

With help from Arabic teachers, and a programme of integrated studies, they acquire a good understanding of Islamic values and knowledge of the culture and heritage of the UAE. On a daily basis, all students have roles and responsibilities within the school community.\nTeaching, across all the school, is good or better. Small class sizes enable teachers to know their students well and to personalise learning. Interactions are strong. The improvement to students' learning skills this year, in both KG and the elementary phase, is contributing to their rapid progress. Effective collaboration, independent learning, and research are features of many lessons across most subjects.\nThe curriculum is generally well-designed, particularly in KG, where there is an appropriate focus on child-centred learning. Non-compliance in Arabic and UAE social studies is limiting student progress and students are not fully benefitting from the diversity around them. Adaptations to the English curriculum, in advance of Japanese (MoE) requirements, are having a positive effect on student achievement.\nChildren in KG benefit from newer accommodation than those students in the upper phases. Improvements to the arrival of buses are promoting student safety. Teachers generally demonstrate high levels of care for all students. The school is beginning to identify those who may need additional support. There are effective procedures to promote positive behaviour and attendance.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe high quality of teaching and the development of students\u2019 learning skills, in all phases, leading to good or better progress in most core subjects\nStudents\u2019 strong personal and social development, in all three phases\nVery positive teacher and student relationships, which support personalised learning\nThe ease of parents\u2019 access to teachers and the high degree to which they are informed about their children\u2019s learning and development.\n",

The overall quality of education provided by the school is acceptable. The section below summarises the inspection findings for each of the six performance indicators described in the framework.\nStudent's attainment in English, mathematics and Arabic is acceptable across all phases. Their attainment in science is acceptable in the primary and middle phases and good in the high school. Students\u2019 progress is mostly acceptable across Arabic, English and mathematics in the primary and middle phases. It is good in the high school in mathematics and science.\nStudent's personal and social development are a strength of the school. Students behave well and have very positive attitudes to learning. They also relate well to each other, to adults in the school and to visitors.\nThe quality of teaching is acceptable in the primary and middle phases and is good in the high school. Whilst teachers\u2019 subject knowledge is adequate, they often do not have a secure understanding of the ways in which students learn. The use of information technology to support and extend students\u2019 learning is still in its infancy.\nThe curriculum, determined by the Iranian Government, is broad and balanced. Whilst it is effective in developing students` knowledge across a range of subjects, the curriculum places less of an emphasis on developing students\u2019 skills. The curriculum is not sufficiently adapted to provide either challenge for the most able or provide support for students with special educational needs (SEND).\nSchool leaders and staff have developed and successfully implemented robust procedures to ensure the safety of students. Students feel safe in an environment that is built on trust, support and mutual respect.\nSenior leaders monitor and review the school`s work regularly and effectively. The self-evaluation informs school improvement planning. Partnerships with parents are increasingly effective. The standard of governance has improved since the previous inspection. There are effective, shared processes for self-evaluation. Governors are beginning to hold the leaders of the school to account.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nLeaders articulate a clear vision and there is a shared and positive sense of purpose throughout the school.\nStudents demonstrate highly positive attitudes and a mature approach to learning, to each other and to adults.\nImprovements in the quality of teaching in the high school have led to improved student progress; this is particularly the case in mathematics and science.\nGood attention is given to ensuring students\u2019 welfare, including their health and safety. Students are happy and feel safe and well supported as individuals.\n",

The average experience of our teaching staff in the disability arena is over 13 years.\nThe organization is now spreading its wings further and is crossing international borders, doing inclusion research & consultancy and is also involved as an intellectual partner with Governmental entities. Manzil\u2019s Ambassador of Inclusion is Chaica S. Al Qassimi. She is also a Self-advocate & representative of Inclusion MENA.\nOur Mission is to actively promote inclusion by providing a professional learning environment for persons with disability to nurture their potential & develop the requisite self help, social, educational & vocational skills that are required to function in society.\nWhy are we unique? At Manzil we work towards shaping an inclusive society. Inclusion is recognizing our universal \u2018oneness\u2019 and interdependence; that we are \u2018one\u2019 even though we are not the \u2018same\u2019. While researchers define inclusion within an educational concept, to us inclusion is more than merely studying together. It is about having equal opportunities for all, being accepted for what one is, being together, working together, living together\u2026\nThe strong focus towards inclusion gives Manzil students a chance to learn academic, social & vocational skills in a mainstream environment. It also gives society the opportunity to be exposed to different abilities and challenges faced by our students. At a young age this opportunity can shape minds and personalities of both those with and without disabilities in an inclusive & positive manner.\nAt Manzil, we believe in empowerment of every student that walks through our doors so that they can lead a life of independence and dignity. We achieve this goal by capacity building of people with varied abilities, raising social awareness and fostering an inclusive society.\nWe firmly believe that if people are exposed to differences amongst individuals and are taught to accept disability as part of life from a young age, then they will grow into responsible adults. In this case, society will not be faced with issues regarding acceptance of differences, whether at an educational, professional or social level. Based on this philosophy, we at Manzil promote inclusive education and work tirelessly towards maximizing the potential of each child and ensure that they participate in the workforce and get woven into the social fabric to make a meaningful contribution to society.\n",

As the school imparts education to match the advancement of technology and globalization, it keeps to its roots with the ethos of moral and ethical principles; never forgetting the values and views of the founder, Kulpati K.M. Munshi, and allowing noble thoughts to come us from every side.\nPWS follows the best Indian curriculum specified by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), New Delhi and would be affiliated with the Board for Grades 9 \u2013 12. There are presently close to 20,000 schools in India and around 2,000 schools outside of India, which follow the curriculum specified by the CBSE. Defined, structured and compact, the focus of the Indian Curriculum is to help develop holistic individuals through co-scholastic school based evaluation, instill values through an integrated curricular approach, develop innovations in teaching-learning methodologies by devising student friendly and student centered paradigms, among others.\nThe emphasis of the curriculum remains on the application of knowledge. The school has its processes in place to link its vision with the CBSE curriculum rationale to ensure that the foundation of the curriculum is meticulously followed in the school. The guiding principles of the curriculum also underpin the need to fire up creativity to reveal to the children a world of possibilities in classroom transactions. The curriculum promotes life skills including communication and critical thinking for originality and authenticity.\nExtra-Curricular activities and Co-curricular activities are a vital part of learning at Pearl Wisdom School. Our school program lays special emphasis on promoting extra-curricular activities and students are encouraged and guided into being confident individuals in their field of interest and also are able to build competence, leadership and competitiveness in whatever they do. An estimated 10-12% of the total learning time in an academic year, is set apart for extra-curricular and co-curricular activities.\nStudents at PWS are offered leadership opportunities during their schooling, to learn the art of building relationships within teams, define identities, and achieve tasks effectively. Students are provided opportunities to learn to identify and display effective communication and interpersonal skills. Monday @Pearl, Modern United Nations, debates, theatre, music, public speaking and so on are some of the activities organized to help students to build global competencies.\nStudents are given prospects to be a part of the school student council wherein they take up leadership roles and help in the decision-making and smooth functioning of the school at the student level. As part of the student council, they organize awareness programmes, encourage students to participate in competitions and also help the teachers in organizing special assemblies and various school events. This helps in building up their organisation, motivation and management skills. They are given ample openings and exposure to scale up their skills and wear the armor of confidence.\nStudents are made to research independently on various topics of international/ global importance and create presentations on the topic of their choice. They get chances to give their opinion on topics related to current affairs. Students read, research and discuss at their family level and at school with their classmates and teachers.\nOur objective oriented activities focus on moulding Bhavanites as responsible citizens with social and global awareness and make them better leaders for the future. This will equip them to face the challenges of the future world with determination and be successful in every other endeavor.\nAs the CBSE curriculum has designated separate learning periods for extra-curricular activites, PWS has gone an extra mile to set up well-equipped classrooms for Arts, Music and Various Performing Arts.\nArt is compulsory for all grades from 1 \u2013 12. Performing Arts and Music are compulsory for grades 1-5. From Grade 6 onwards, it is elective and a student may choose either Performing Arts or Music.\nAt PWS, we strive to live up to our vision of having a school where learning is fostered in an open and creative environment, whereby students grow to explore situations that challenge them.\nWe endeavor to provide our students experiences within and beyond our classrooms so as to become independent and creative. The school also provides a holistic education experience that ensures high standards of academic excellence complemented by a kaleidoscope of co-curricular activities. Our team of Academic leaders ensure that the school is planned to provide a stimulating environment promoting a variety of teaching and learning styles, emphasizing the progress and achievement of individual students. Concerted efforts in this direction makes PWS stand out distinctly amongst the leading CBSE schools in Dubai.\nPWS aims to be an institution of excellence, dedicated to producing leaders of the future. To fulfill this, we provide an environment in which every student discovers and realizes his or her full potential. As a truly global institution, we are on a constant lookout for attracting the best talent \u2013 students, teachers and facilitators \u2013 from all parts of India and the world, without distinction of race, religion, caste, or social status.\nOur mission at PWS is to provide a conducive environment using latest infrastructure and modern facilities in school, for a future-oriented learning community, anchored in a rigorous high quality academic programme, for students. We seek to empower our students to apply their acquired skills and knowledge, and to rely upon their personal attributes to lead productive lives and thereby become contributing members of the global community.\nBhavans Dubai carries with it the distinctiveness of having devoted fourteen fruitful years to the noble cause of providing quality education to the students across the Middle East, embracing the motto of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, \u201cLet noble thoughts come to us from every side.\u201d Here too our children willingly accept noble thoughts; thoughts are not forced upon them.\nAt Bhavans Dubai, we nurture in our children the courage to appreciate the charm of challenges, and the beauty of opportunities. Our instructional practices provide opportunities for children to explore, initiate, discover and reflect to become self-directed learners. They are made to tread the paths of independence, responsibility, tolerance and resilience to transform themselves into promising global citizens.\n",

Inaugurated in 1994, the Centre aims to ensure that international standards of excellence in education and therapy are maintained at every level. The Centre is unique in the Emirates for providing a holistic multi disciplinary approach to special education.Each child receives a programme specially designed to meet his or her individual needs. Parents are encouraged to participate in all aspects of the Centre's functioning and to be actively involved in their child's learning.\nThe Rashid Centre aims to provide high quality, integrated education services and therapies for children with special needs. The center's purpose is to develop children's abilities to function and learn within their environments, that is, home, school, and community, and to develop maximum independence and participation in these environments.\nOur aim is to deliver services that set high standards and expectations for children with special needs residing in the UAE, and to develop awareness and an understanding of disability issues in the Gulf Community.\nRashid Center for the Disabled is characterized by the multiplicity of its activities throughout the year ranging from visits and receptions, organizing forums and workshops, to participating in events and activities related to the disabled, and charitable and humanitarian work in general. The center receives an enthusiastic reception and praise by the organizers. The media in its various sections are usually invited to cover these events, or at least promote it in the media via press releases issued by the center. Those events are often publicized by a privileged media coverage and are a place of praise by the community, which contributes to the deployment of community awareness of the centre\u2019s message, its activities and events that make the center an all year round buzzing beehive.\nThe Centre has 20 classes in the Learning Difficulties section, with children ranging from infants to 18 years. The classes are divided according to language of instruction, with half the classes being taught in Arabic and the other half in English. The Centre offers programs for children who have moderate - severe learning difficulties. This can also include children who also have physical disabilities, although in general they need to have some form of independent mobility, with a walking aid of some kind. Children join classes according to their age and the type of program they require.\nThe Centre offers holistic programs, working on all areas of the child's development. This includes cognitive development, language and communication, self-care skills, socialisation and play, and gross and fine motor skills. Class sizes are small to allow for intensive, focuses teaching. The therapists work with individual children and groups, as well as working co-operatively with the teachers, to ensure the children are given every opportunity to develop skills in all areas. Preference is given to practical, experiential learning, to ensure tasks are meaningful and motivating to children. All classes are able to make use of the facilities in the Centre, such as the soft playroom, the sports hall and swimming pool, the library, the kitchen, and the music and art rooms. The outside area is landscaped, with play equipment and sitting areas.\nClasses have between 6 and 10 students, with a teacher and a classroom assistant. All the teachers at the Centre hold a recognised qualification in Special Education. All classes have access to specialist Music Therapy and Art.\nThe loss of any part of the body does not constitute the end of life, it is the beginning of the insistence, communication and altruism. The loss of any sense of the senses of the body does not constitute the end of the road, but it is the beginning of creativity and inspiration, and so are our children with disabilities in \"Rashid Center for the Disabled\", who managed to gain the trust, compassion ,respect, and appreciation of everyone, not only through their disability but through determination and defiance of their disabilities, which enabled them to reach places no one would imagine they can get to, thanks to their will, and they are now stars in a variety of areas in life, most notably the arts.\nThe state has persevered since its inception to work to serve the people of this segment in all therapeutic, educational, rehabilitative fields, and it tried as much as possible to provide them with treatment centers that can contribute to the rehabilitation, and it is working as well to integrate them into the community, giving them all the rights they deserve similar to their fully fitted counterparts. The UAE is a pioneer in this regard, where the state signed all international conventions and treaties that guarantee to people with special needs of their rights, safeguard human dignity, and it worked as well on the adoption of a wide range of laws, decisions and initiatives that ensure them a decent life and real integration in the community, in addition to the right to work and earn a living, without waiting for a help.\nThis category was, and still is, of interest and patronage of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, \" May God protect him\", and His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, \"May God bless him\u201d, and their Highnesses the Supreme Council Members and rulers of the Emirates. The needs of this category were taken into account in the infrastructure of major projects, as well as streets, bridges, tunnels, subway, shopping malls and other in high efficiency and a deep study of the different requirements and needs was conducted.\n",

In addition, a new philosophy, vision-mission statement, and school objectives were introduced.\nThe terms and concepts that were utilized are articulated from the UAE National agenda, and from the concept of multiculturalism. The former concept is something that we aspire for in a long-run, which means TPS will promote Filipino values and culture, in full consideration to UAE heritage and policies. We would like every member of the school to respect diversity and individual beliefs.\nIn relation to faculty capability building, the TPS Instructional Supervisory Framework was likewise conceptualized this school year. This framework is categorically divided into two formative or non-evaluative and summative or evaluative. In addition, the framework aims to set a benchmark of performance, gather data to provide formative assessment of teacher\u2019s instructional competency, enhance teachers\u2019 competency, professionalism, and collegiality through peer collaboration, and provide assistance and support to teachers on areas such as lesson planning, strategies, innovation, and assessment.\nWe believe that education stimulates nation building; however, it is not a mere acquisition of knowledge and skills. It needs to be unified with values and character. Our ultimate purpose is to hone the hearts and the minds of every individual to prepare them for their role in the society.\nThank you for treating TPS as your family. We look forward to meeting you and talking about the real meaning of education and the well-meant learning advocacies of TPS.\nThe school was established on February 20, 2008 and formally opened its first academic year in September of the same year. Following its opening, the school received a DepEd Recognition for being an accredited Philippine school overseas and a Commendation Certificate from the Knowledge and Human Development Authority. Located in Al Twar during its foundation, the school was moved to Al Rashidiya in 2010. In January 2017, TPS moved to its current building in Al Muhaisnah 2.\nThe school offers complete programs from Kindergarten 1 to Grade 12. Through the years, TPS has attuned its curriculum to that in the Philippines to provide easy transition if the student needs to be relocated back home. Additional subjects are offered to comply with the national requirements of the host country.\nIn response to the interminable advancement of education, TPS submitted itself for inspection with the Dubai School Inspection Bureau. True to its vision of being a \u201cLeader in Academic Excellence and Values Formation,\u201d The Philippine School continuously provides exceptional academic training for children through experiential, integrative, multicultural, and values-oriented learning.\n",

So we believe that the international wing of T.I.S. promote a curriculum which teaches values of our Muslim culture while still maintaining the modern versions of education around the world. We aim to coincide with the U.A.E.\u2019s current enhancement of education in order to achieve the quality of education.\nUpon Sheikh Rashid\u2019s (then-ruler of Dubai) consent and the authorization issue from Iran\u2019s Ministry of Culture, \u2018Dubai\u2019s Iranian Primary School\u2019 is established. The Iranian Culture Authority starts the school in an old small building which is the property of an Iranian erchant, Mr. Abdullah Kazem; simultaneously, Iran\u2019s Ministry of Culture starts constructing an equipped building; in 1958, Dubai\u2019s Iranian Primary School moves to the then-newly-constructed building (the previous location of Towheed Iranian Boys School). The primary school starts with six mixed classes admitting around 210 students.\nIranian students\u2019 report card headlines and official correspondence show that the Iranian school has been active under the supervision of the Culture Office of Iranian south ports (Bushehr) up to 1966 \u2013 1967. Investigating the correspondence, one can see that after the formation of the U.A.E. in 1971, the Iranian schools Directorate starts responsibility for running and developing Iranian schools in the Emirates.\nDuring the first few years, the Iranian schools Directorate is also responsible for the Iranian Cultural Consulate and after that Iran\u2019s Ministry of Education appoints the schools Director in the U.A.E. to continue running and developing Iranian schools in the Emirates.\nIn 1971 \u2013 1972 along with the changes in Iran\u2019s educational system to incorporate \u2018a three-year educational guidance period\u2019, the first middle school class starts as an attachment to \u2018Dubai\u2019s Iranian Primary School\u2019. Later, \u2018Middle School\u2019 and \u2018High School\u2019 continue their activities in a shared place. The new high school system takes the place of the old one admitting students in the fields of mathematics-physics, experiential sciences, economy, social sciences, and commerce.\nEver since, \u2018Dubai\u2019s Iranian High School\u2019 admits both middle school and new-system high school girl and boy students. In 1980, after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, the high school separates girls and boys and \u2018Martyr Muhammad Baqer Sadr Girls High School\u2019 gets independent since 1980 \u2013 1981. In 1983 \u2013 1984, the middle school seeks independence; hence \u2018Dubai\u2019s Iranian Boys Middle School\u2019 starts. It is not precisely known when this boys school changes name to \u2018Bu Ali Sina\u2019, but one can guess it does between 1983 to 1986. With the middle school getting independent, \u2018Martyr Muhammad Baqer Sadr Girls High School\u2019 admits arts students in the field of automatics and this way a girls conservatory is attached to the high school located next to it. The conservatory continues to 1988 \u2013 1989 and then ends graduating a total of 90 grade-12 arts students. For one year in 1983 \u2013 1984, the girls high school and the boys middle school are independent with respective principals and after that, one principal runs the two schools to 1991 \u2013 1992. With the ending of the conservatory, students are admitted only in the fields of mathematics-physics, experiential sciences, culture and literature, and social sciences.\nIn 1995 \u2013 1996, the building designed for \u2018Salman School\u2019 is completed and continues independent activities. In 1980, \u2018Khadije Kobra (PBUH) Girls School\u2019 starts responsibility for \u2018Zahra (PBUH) Middle School\u2019 and \u2018Khadije Kobra (PBUH) High School\u2019. Along with the development of Iranian schools in Dubai, \u2018Abu Dhabi School\u2019 is established with the formation of the U.A.E. in 1971. Three years later in 1974, \u2018Sharjah School\u2019 is established in Naeemie and starts educating Iranian children in the Emirate of Sharjah.\nNow the schools Directorate is the authority for all affairs: planning for, organizing, directing, coordinating, and supervising eight schools. The eight schools, with a 6,000 student population, are: Towheed International and Boys School, Towheed Girls School, Khadije Kobra (PBUH) Girls School, Salman Boys School, Sharjah Boys and Girls School, Imam Khomeini (MBUH) Boys and Girls School in Abu Dhabi, Al Ain Boys and Girls School, and Adab Private Boys and Girls School.\n",

Students' progress in mathematics in the middle school is good, due to the improved teaching and learning strategies used in this phase. Students achieve better overall in the high school phase, with attainment and progress being mostly good.\nStudents' behaviour and attendance is a strength of the school. Students\u2019 awareness of Islamic values and their understanding of UAE and Iranian cultures are strengths. However, students are less knowledgeable about other cultures.\nIn all phases of the school, teachers have secure subject knowledge and they are keen for their students to do well. They plan their lessons but do not consistently or effectively plan to meet the different learning needs of all students. They are developing their teaching strategies, especially in the middle school. However, assessment data are not used effectively to identify the next steps in learning for individual students.\nThe curriculum, although extended, remains limited in terms of choice and variety for all students. It is modified to meet the learning needs of the majority of students. However, teachers do not consistently adapt learning experiences to reflect individual needs in lessons.\nHealth and safety are good across the school. The learning environment is clean, welcoming and rich with students' displays in all areas of the school. Provision for students with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) has improved but outcomes remain acceptable.\nThe new school leaders are committed to school improvement. Parents are supportive of the school and play an active role in governance. Plans for improvement and the school's self-evaluation are not fully aligned.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nStudents\u2019 very good personal development and positive work ethic.\nThe steps taken by the leadership team to begin the process of meeting the recommendations from the previous report and their dedication to the development of the school.\nStudents make good progress and achieve well in mathematics and science in the middle and high school phases.\n",

In the primary and middle phases, students\u2019 attainment levels in English, mathematics and science are good. However, in Islamic education and Arabic as an additional language, students\u2019 attainment remains acceptable.  Students across the school have enhanced their levels of progress to good in the three key subjects of English, mathematics and science. However, in Islamic education and Arabic as an additional language, students\u2019 progress remains acceptable, except in Arabic in the primary phase, which is good. The quality of learning skills evident across the school has improved to be consistently good.\nAcross the school, students demonstrate positive attitudes, behaviours and relationships. Their attendance and punctuality reach the highest levels. Students\u2019 understanding of Islamic values and awareness of Emirati and world cultures are good. However, while students\u2019 social responsibility and environmental action are showing some improvement, this is less so in their development of the skills of innovation.\nThe quality of teaching is good across the school. Teachers\u2019 planning in Kindergarten is noted for its inclusion of differentiated approaches, while teachers in upper grades are incorporating cross-curricular links, real life applications and opportunities for student leadership. The promotion of critical thinking is not a strong feature of teaching across the school. The school\u2019s assessment systems are consistent, coherent and increasingly rigorous. The use of external benchmark data provides detailed and focused information to support improved student attainment.\nThe school combines elements of the National Curriculum for England with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) curriculum to meet international benchmarks. Curriculum planning ensures that students develop the knowledge, skills and understanding that is age-appropriate and meets the requirements of the CBSE curriculum. The school modifies its curriculum to meet the needs of groups of students, including students of determination and those with gifts and talents. It is adapted effectively to provide interesting, age-appropriate and meaningful learning experiences that motivate and engage most students.\nThe provision for health and safety, including arrangements for child protection, is well\u00ad established and is of a high standard. Students are provided with a safe well-resourced learning environment. Positive staff-student relationships exist around the school and are reported in the Dubai student well-being survey. Incidences of bullying are rare.\nThe quality of leadership and management of the school is consistently good. The principal articulates with clarity the school\u2019s vision, the school\u2019s contribution to the UAE national priorities and the development of this inclusive learning community. The school is developing a stronger, more consistent data-driven knowledge of its strengths and areas for development. Parents are extremely happy with the improved quality of their children\u2019s learning and the safety and support offered by the school. Governance is evolving and beginning to impact through its increased overview of the school and continues to provide resources. The day-to-day management of the school is both effective and efficient.\nSchool\u2019s strengths\nThe principal\u2019s clearly articulated vision, embraced by the Governors and stakeholders to enhance student achievement through improved teaching, learning and assessment\nThe strong development of distributive leadership to support the school\u2019s continuous improvement\nThe school\u2019s inclusive ethos, providing for all students, including students of determination\nThe safe, happy, orderly learning environment, supported by the developing and substantial range of usable resources.\n",

This ensures that our students are supported by the school and the home and will be prepared to transition successfully to university; whether local or overseas.\nWe believe in an approach that instills the love of learning - where students can thrive and achieve their very best as independent, agentic learners. Each and every child is unique and our program offers extensive opportunities for students to develop strengths in a range of areas. Daily, we are committed to a child-centered approach to education, taking actions based on each child\u2019s differentiated and learning needs. Our students will become critical thinkers able to analyze, reason, and reflect, giving them the skills needed to progress and to be successful in any area. Because English is an additional language for many of our students, building a solid foundation in both the Arabic mother tongue and English languages is key. In turn, this supports Arabic language and Islamic religion development while ensuring success with the American curricular program.\nOur rigorous assessment processes assist us in supporting students to make progress towards their attainment targets because we start where the student is and develop from there. With support mechanisms in place across both the Arabic and American curricular program progress and achievement are assured so that students develop proficiency across all of the Ministry of Education subjects.\nOur teachers are hired both internationally and locally to ensure staff are of the highest standard, with the right blend of enthusiasm, knowledge, and experience in the region, to help our students achieve their potential. We provide an engaging learning environment where teachers can facilitate a holistic approach to learning. This provides students with a wide range of opportunities - both in and out of the classroom - thereby promoting their social, emotional, and academic development. This style of teaching is underpinned by respect and appreciation of the core cultural values of honesty, loyalty, perseverance, and compassion.\nFurthermore, we offer an extensive array of Extra-Curricular Activities (ECAs) that infuse student leadership, critical thinking, social awareness, and creativity and innovation into our learning journey. We guide students to develop and grow into morally upright and respectful citizens who embrace UAE culture and values while embracing an inclusive and a strong global perspective. Developing leadership qualities results in students having a significant impact on our DSM school community, the UAE, and the world. Such encouragement builds a collective understanding of each person\u2019s social responsibilities towards a shared world.\nStrong communication with each member of our school community allows all the comfort of expressing thoughts and ideas that build a vibrant school community.\nWe are committed to hearing from parents about how their child\u2019s school experiences and how we can collaborate in support of our long term planning and future development. We encourage parent participation in the classroom and on school trips, as well as on our Parent Council, thus enabling us to foster a mutual commitment to our Mission and beliefs.\nBecause the vision and mission of Dubai Schools Mirdif dovetail with the national priorities of the UAE. The main objective of the Dubai Schools Mirdif Project is to create a mutually beneficial partnership between the government and the private sector that ensures Dubai\u2019s aspiration to have 100% of Emirati Students enrolled in 'Good+' rated schools by 2021.\nFuture-ready\nEquipping students with the necessary life skills to face future challenges, both national and global, with resilience, while encouraging them to be ambitious self-directed learners.\nTrust & Empathy\nDeveloping a home-school relationship based on trust and respect, while fostering a welcoming school environment in order for every student to flourish and every parent to feel reassured. Bringing empathy into our classrooms and embedding it as a core value.\nCollaboration & Inclusion\nAn outstanding quality of education accessible to all learners extends an all-rounded opportunity for each and every student.\nCultural Preservation\nAmerican education grounded in Emirati culture and values offers a progressive learning environment to learn and grow. The school environment itself is guided by Arabic and Islamic principles and values, while the curriculum fosters tolerance, independence, as well an international mindset.\nAcademic excellence\nBy delivering a strong American curriculum with excellence in teaching and learning through its caring, inspiring, and inclusive environment. The curriculum will also prepare and inspire students to contribute positively to a rapidly changing world. Problem-solving, critical thinking, and life skills will be core values infused in their education, providing the students with a global perspective and context.\nDubai Schools Mission\nTo be a Beacon of Academic Excellence\nCombining an inquisitive teaching approach and future-focused skillset delivery, we work hand-in-hand with the community to nurture students to become independent and empathetic learners. We offer an American education that will be guided by Arabic principles and Islamic values which will foster future-ready graduates, driven by pride and tolerance.\nDubai Schools Curriculum\nInternational education, with a focus on Arabic language and Islamic values\nDubai Schools Mirdif will offer an American Curriculum based on the New York State Education Department \u2013 NYSED, leading to an American high-school diploma. Focused on empowering and inspiring students across a variety of abilities and backgrounds. The curriculum will nurture empathetic and self-driven students who will embody personal values of responsibility, tolerance and pride.\n",

It offers its students a world-class, balanced education which focuses on the academic and emotional development of each student.\nThe school is licensed by the UAE Ministry of Education and according to its directive a program of Arabic Language, Arabic Social Studies and Islamic Studies (for Muslim children) is provided.\nEPSK is a place that provides a progressive alternative to conventional methods in education. The school explores advanced approaches to education that are forward-thinking and aim to equip students with appropriate skills for the 21st century.\nWe provide a safe and intellectually challenging environment that will empower students to become innovative thinkers, creative problem solvers, and inspired learners, prepared to thrive in the highly competitive world of today. High standards and expectations for each student with regard to academic performance, co-curricular participation, and responsible citizenship are the foundation of our school.\nAs per the International Commission on Education for the Twenty-first Century to UNESCO, a desire to learn continuously throughout one`s lifetime is a mark of sound intellect. And that\u2019s exactly what we, at EPSK, strive to spark in our students, a desire to learn continuously.\nThe Commission`s 1996 report, \u2018Learning: The Treasure Within,\u2019 highlighted that individuals need to \u201clearn how to learn\u201d to cope with the rapid changes and challenges of time and the future. It describes a holistic approach to learning that encompasses more than what the classroom provides. This is referred to as lifelong learning- a philosophy that involves the development of skills, attitudes, and values throughout one`s life - from early childhood through adulthood. Learning is thus, not just an intellectual process, but one that encompasses all aspects of an individual`s life, including the community, performance in the workplace, personal development, and physical well-being.\nAs per educationists, we can organize lifelong learning into four pillars: i) learning to know, ii) learning to live together, iii) learning to do, and iv) learning to be. The four pillars are seen as fundamental principles for reshaping 21st-century education.\nAnd so, at EPSK our approach is to make our students independent and lifelong learners. Our classrooms are vibrant with student-centered environments, where inquiry-based approaches are balanced with direct teaching. Our teachers actively strive to encourage children\u2019s natural curiosity and love of learning. They take great care to support each child\u2019s social and emotional growth.\nThis brings us to the importance we lay on a strong parent-teacher relationship. We encourage parents to be active participants in school life and welcome them to be part of our family events and class activities.\nSo, as we pursue our journey of nurturing young minds and ensuring their sound, all-around development at EPSK, we hope and wish that we continue to smoothly overcome the vicissitudes of time and successfully achieve our school\u2019s vision and mission.\nMission: Every student at the English Private School of Kalba will be a confident, action-driven team player with a love for learning, and someone who radiates the school\u2019s Core values. Our students will become independent learners, critical thinkers, and problem-solvers well-equipped with 21st-century skills.\nVision: Student preparation in the K to 12 education system for leading a productive life in this dynamic world to contribute to the sustainable development of the UAE society.\nCore Values\nStrengthen National Identity and social responsibility.\nFoster the values of Islam in dialogue, and show tolerance,\nmoderation, peace, and generosity.\nUphold the essential virtues of respect, discipline, integrity, sportsmanship, and honesty.\nEncourage a peace-loving\nattitude and excel at conflict resolution.\nProfessional development of staff and the recognition of excellence.\nComplete child inclusive future-based education, setting high expectations and instilling positive self-worth in every child.\nCommunity involvement and parental engagement in all aspects of school life.\nAt English Private School Kalba we are committed to the provision of a broad and balanced learning experience for our children, with opportunities for everyone to feel successful and shine in their own way. We know that there is also a place for unexpected and planned breaks from routine to keep things fresh and exciting.\nWith a new class, we feel that it is important to spend time on establishing the teacher\u2019s expectations, explaining routines and drawing up class rules with the children. This needs regular reinforcement at the beginning and should be consistently applied.\nClass rules should be drawn up and displayed in the first week. They should be expressed positively where possible. treatment (courtesy, manners and respect).\nAll children must be taught to value the recording of their work, both as a record of their achievement and as evidence of consistently meeting the standards and expectations set. They must be expected and encouraged to take pride in their work and to see their work as valued by all members of the community.\nWe encourage children to take some responsibility for their own learning, to be involved in reviewing their progress and the way they learn best, what helps them learn and what makes it difficult for them to learn. Where we can, we think it is important also to build-in elements of choice within a task and to provide opportunities for children to plan their own time/learning.\n",

The significance of this important step is realized in view of the fact that investing in education and training is an investment in the future; knowledge and skills are the engine of economic growth and social development.'\nOur programs in the Applied Technology High Schools and the Secondary Technical Schools are designed to build on students\u2019 competencies, identifying and refining their talents through the vocational training courses and numerous specialized programs offered by schools, including varied enrichment programs and differentiation in teaching students that face academic learning difficulties.\nOur institutes have today become a great edifice that has an excellent stand and a good reputation in the UAE society allowing us to compete with many scientific educational institutions that have long been shaping the minds and disciplining the souls.

IAT\u2019s mission is to promote various programs of study in order to meet the industrial and technical requirements of the UAE, and provide appropriate specializations to cover the industrial and technical requirements for a competent workforce. While career clusters are designed and customized in accordance to local community needs and requirements, enrollment in a particular program is primarily dependent on student interests and academic achievement.\nThe IAT curriculum is designed to offer standards-based rigorous academic core combined with hands-on cluster based courses. The Curriculum Matrix details the distribution of periods per week for each subject area, each period being 45 minutes with a total of 40 periods per week. The term \u201cCluster Requirements\u201d under Subjects refers only to the total number of periods designated to career cluster courses.\n",

During their time at the school, our students also learn the skills required to apply their understanding of scientific and mathematical concepts to find solutions to \u201creal world\u201d problems and challenges. Cross-curricular project work (for example through the STEAM initiative and preparation for national competitions) provides an opportunity for our students to work in teams, to be creative, to develop their design and innovation skills, and to discover the satisfaction of a \u201chands-on\u201d approach to learning. Through team-based learning activities we develop our students\u2019 21st century skills of collaboration, communication and positive competition. Every day we challenge our students to be evaluative, to think critically, and to use these skills to make positive choices in their lives. And through cultural events, competitions, sport and other activities we aim to inspire our students with a sense of purpose, enthusiasm, personal ambition and a high level of patriotism.\nThroughout their time at the school, our students benefit from the valuable partnerships that we have developed with business and industrial organizations in the UAE and overseas. Through a programme of work placements, internships, industrial visits and guest speakers, these partnerships provide a firm foundation from which our students can orientate themselves to the world of work, develop their vocational skills, and understand the many exciting career pathways available to them.\nSince the establishment in 2005, IAT was envisioned as a world class integrated educational system of career-based technical education that would produce the scientists, engineers, and technicians needed for the UAE to build a knowledge-based economy. IAT\u2019s mission is to promote various programs of study in order to meet the industrial and technical requirements of the UAE, and provide appropriate specializations to cover the industrial and technical requirements for a competent workforce. While career clusters are designed and customized in accordance to local community needs and requirements, enrollment in a particular program is primarily dependent on student interests and academic achievement.\nThe IAT curriculum is designed to offer standards-based rigorous academic core combined with hands-on cluster based courses. The Curriculum Matrix details the distribution of periods per week for each subject area, each period being 45 minutes with a total of 45 periods per week. The term \u201cCluster Requirements\u201d under Subjects refers only to the total number of periods designated to career cluster courses.\n",

Our school site near University City is readily accessible to students from Sharjah, Ajman, Mirdiff and most of Dubai.\nAs a not-for-profit school, SES is dedicated to providing an outstanding education comparable to the best schools in the Gulf region and internationally. Our educational ethos will always remain focused on quality teaching and learning, rather than any commercial imperative; this, we claim, has a profound impact on both our students and teachers.\nAs the smallest not-for-profit school in the UAE, SES can claim to combine strong educational values with an intimate, community atmosphere.\nSince the establishment of the secondary section of the school in 2005, we have catered for students aged 3 to 19, with classes now running from Foundation through to A-level, following a broad, challenging and balanced curriculum based on the National Curriculum of England and Wales.\nIn addition to academic success, the school offers a varied and enviable range of extracurricular opportunities and has established a proud reputation for music, arts and success in sport. The Sports Hall, swimming pool and extensive grassed playing areas are amongst the most impressive school sporting facilities in the country. The Performing Arts Building, opened by The Ruler of Sharjah in 2012, has greatly enhanced our facilities by providing us with an outstanding auditorium, whole-school library, a new ICT Suite, Learning Support Rooms, Music Rooms etc. Our latest project was the addition of Acorn Building, an exciting new block designed with the learning experiences of KG and infant children in mind.\nA developing school, fully staffed by UK qualified teachers, SES prides itself on a friendly and inclusive atmosphere, and enjoys close links with both parents and the community. Growth in our student numbers is gradual and controlled; the school is determined to retain the feel and characteristics of a small and intimate institution, where the needs of every student are catered for.\nEnrolment now stands at 850 children. SES students represent over fifty nationalities, and our diversity is one of our greatest strengths.\nIt is our claim as a school that we provide children with an excellent education in a caring and enriching environment. People familiar with the school would point to its inclusive, community ethos and its happy working atmosphere as its chief characteristics.\nHaving built on the success of our long-established Primary School, and successfully developed our Secondary School and new site, the school stands at the threshold of an exciting new phase which has seen us add a new primary block in 2017, and expand towards a three-form intake throughout the school. With the support of our Board of Governors, we strive to improve our provision and facilities continually.\nBut buildings and sports fields do not of themselves make a wonderful school. It is the willingness to confront challenges confidently and to set high goals for themselves that makes our students exceptional; the commitment of our teachers to enable, support and challenge the students is what our graduates comment on and will remember throughout their lives.\nA website can only give you a glimpse of our school. To experience the true atmosphere of our unique school, prospective parents, teachers and students are encouraged to visit us during term time and to meet the staff and children.\nOur Teachers: All our teachers are experienced UK trained specialists. At the heart of our school\u2019s success is our ability to recruit and retain hard-working, committed staff who can deliver imaginative and inspiring lessons. Teachers all undertake continuous professional development while at SES, and indeed lead other schools in raising standards and keeping abreast of educational developments.\nOur Ethos: The distinction of being a not-for-profit school has a profound impact on the schooling experience of children, staff and parents. Our focus is on teaching and learning \u2013 not on bowing to any commercial pressures from owners or sponsors.\nOur Sense of Community: One cannot think of SES without the word \u2018community\u2019 suggesting itself. Because of the size of the ex-patriate community in Sharjah, the school is more central to the local community than is possible in a larger more anonymous urban setting. Our families and students regard the school as having a pivotal place in community life. Parents are heavily involved in the school, an engagement that is supportive and enriching.\nOur Size: With only three form intake up to Year 8 and two form intake in the remainder of secondary, our school remains small by UAE standards. This permits staff to have an acute knowledge of every student, and permits the secure and supportive relationships needed to permit children to embrace challenges. Our commitment is to remain small enough to preserve our palpable community and family feel.\nOur Success: Ultimately, however pleasant or supportive the learning experience, parents expect a school to deliver excellent results and to enable children to move on successfully to their next phase of education, whether in the UK or internationally. Most importantly, senior students expect and deserve the opportunity to access the top universities and colleges in the world. SES has established an enviable record of examination success; nearly all our graduating students find places at their first choice university, including the most renowned institutions worldwide.\nOur Site and Sports Facilities: at just under 100,000 square metres, our school site (generously donated by HH The Ruler of Sharjah) is amongst the largest of any UAE school. This permits us to maintain playing fields which few schools in the region can match, and which host numerous Sharjah and Dubai inter-school events. Plenty of space remains on our site for all future building and facility needs.\nOur Music and Drama: For a comparatively small school, SES enjoys huge success and a magnificent reputation at national and Gulf level for the quality of its performing arts. Music and drama opportunities exist from Foundation level, through to examination classes in secondary. The majority of SES students will experience the rush and confidence that being on stage can bring. Students will remember their experiences in these areas long after they have left school.\n",

It was founded by three dynamic, self-motivated ladies, namely Miss Aghsan Musa who was the Vice-President and member of the Board of Directors, Mrs. Myrtle Fernandez who was in-charge of financial matters, and Mrs. Zenaida Dizon who was the very first NFPS principal. They were assisted by two well-rounded educators, Mrs. Luzviminda P. Corpuz, our Subject Coordinator then, and Mrs. Lolita Irong, our Academic Chairman, together with Mrs. Anna Castillo who was the school Registrar then. Its first year of operation was successfully launched on 14 September 1996. It was initially manned by 21 well-experienced and highly qualified teachers meticulously screened from various schools in Manila both private and public.\nThe NFPS used to be housed in villas in Ramla, but after the ruling of the Ministry of Education to vacate villas and either build or move to a school building, it has, since then, been operating in a government school building. It is situated in Dasman \u2013 just a few hundred meters away from Qur\u2019an round about, making it accessible to all Filipino communities especially those who reside in Sharjah.\nIts academic operation is systematically planned day-after-day to make sure that everything is in the right track. Teachers from pre-school to high school are closely monitored by Grade Level and Subject Coordinators checking their classroom performance and academic competence. Directly under the principal is her assistant who helps her oversee all activities, academic and non-academic alike. The principal in the person of Mrs. Luzviminda P. Corpuz sees to it that all pre- planned activities are systematically carried out.\nThe NFPS takes the pride in being known as one of the Filipino schools producing graduates who excel in their chosen field of endeavors in the most prestigious colleges and universities in Canada, United Kingdom, United States and back home \u2013 University of Santo Tomas, University of the Philippines, De La Salle University, just to name a few. Its graduates who are now professionals earned their degrees with highest honors in these universities.\nThe NFPS believes that education does not only mean equipping students with academic competence, but it also means keeping them physically fit and religiously responsive. This means giving them well-planned, well-balanced activities that would lead to their becoming well-formed, well-adjusted individuals. Members of The NFPS Varsity Teams are given regular trainings as early as the second quarter of the academic year. This is to prepare them for our yearly inter-school athletic competitions. Indeed, The New Filipino Private School is a haven for those who seek an education that is truly well-rounded and truly Filipino.\nThe New Filipino Private School believes in the holistic development of its learners. It stands by its commitment to provide quality education through active involvement in the teaching-learning process, provision of opportunities to strengthen their potentials, and creation of programs to match their developmental level and learning styles.\n",

It also prepares them for further education in some of the most prestigious colleges and universities worldwide. We provide the best start to your child\u2019s education in a warm and supportive learning environment that allows them to shine academically and socially. We also prepare them to become valued members of the global community and develop the attributes they need to become lifelong learners.\nA unique feature at Al-Murooj School is the one-on-one relationship between the teacher and the student. The teacher makes the classes exciting and inspiring with patience, care, and concern. The classrooms are not characterised by monotonous monologues but by highly interactive sessions.\nOur students can regularly visit different places of interest as part of their learning process. A spectrum of activities is planned in the curriculum to help the children excel in their capacities. Activities like arts and crafts help the children develop their motor skills, while coaching them in arts like painting, listening, speaking, and sports help them vibrate with positive energy.\nAs a child comes to Grade 4, there is a remarkable change in personality, intellectual capacity, and behavioural patterns. As a child approaches adolescence and begins to tread the path of life, they need constant motivation, a watchful eye, appreciation, and much love and care. At this crucial point of the child\u2019s life, the child\u2019s energy is diverted towards positive activities; aptitudes are identified, encouragement is given in all spheres, and personal counselling is provided.\nThe school features a library service that encourages the children\u2019s reading habits and triggers critical and lateral thinking through reviews.

In ICT classes, technology makes its presence felt, with each child having a chance to master the world of electronics.\nThe methodology adopted at the primary level of education stresses an interactive approach through group activities and hands-on activities. The children are given specific projects to help develop an investigative mind. The classroom becomes alive with keen questions and convincing answers. In the primary grades, learning in the school is not merely confined to textbooks. Extra time is given for discussion of current affairs, and to develop the general knowledge of the students, the latest audio-visual presentations are used.\nToday, AMES is one of the country\u2019s leading academic schools, and students achieve exceptional examination results. Our campus is a busy, passionate, and purposeful place where independent and deep thinking are enjoyed, encouraged, and respected by all and where holistic excellence is achieved. While we urge students to embrace the values of liberal education and a deep and rigorous learning process, we also encourage them to examine, question, and investigate the content of that learning and push boundaries to confront expectations.\n",

A world citizen; erudite, able to accept diverse cultures and values while holding on to his own. A humane person; an eco friendly citizen of the world. These are big targets, but unless you reach for the stars, you will not touch the moon!\nThe philosophy behind the establishment of Ibn Seena English High School as a premier educational institution has been that while academic achievement is a necessary focus, it should not need to be at the expense of other areas of a child\u2019s development. By placing an equal emphasis on a child\u2019s social, moral and psychological development, students who would graduate from such an institution would be well equipped to deal with real world challenges.\nThe primary objective at Ibn Seena English High school was to create a safe environment where children would be encouraged to learn through trial and experiential activities. The children would be encouraged to take risks, ask questions and participate actively in school life and activities with the goal of creating confident, enquiring minds. Students would also be guided towards self discipline as an emphasis would be placed on self-regulation instead of regimentation. A natural evolution of such an environment and approach would be the creation of an ethos of respect for self and others. Students would embrace diversity and a collaborative culture would evolve.\nToday Ibn Seena English High School represents the realization of this vision. For almost 35 years this school has been true to it\u2019s original philosophy and approach. The quality of the graduates is evident in the number of students who are accepted in leading colleges around the world and also in the number of students who go on to succeed in their professions. The Alumni record is a testament to the achievement of these past students. Ibn Seena is exceptionally proud of the fact that it is an institution that has consistently offered the highest quality of education at a affordable price - This has allowed many families access to quality education which would otherwise be out of their reach. The majority of students at Ibn Seena come from homes where English is never spoken and either one or both parents have not even completed High school education. In spite of this handicap, students at Ibn Seena perform exceptionally well in International assessments and their achievements contribute to the advancement of their families.\nWe provide access to affordable education for all, within a fertile and safe environment where students learn to think creatively and translate those ideas into action. We equip students with a holistic set of skills and attitudes that empower them to be successful in any and all endeavors they choose to undertake in their lives. By doing so we create students who are enlightened, confident, self-directed learners who embrace and respect diversity. These students become active contributors, collaborators, and leaders within their communities, families and professional fields.\nWe see ourselves creating a generation of socially adept, ecologically conscious, and tolerant innovators who can adapt to global situations and changes. We will achieve this by our continued commitment to providing quality education with a dedicated team of teachers. Our teachers will continue to receive professional development training to enable them to meet the evolving needs of the 21st Century learners through the use of creative teaching techniques, technological resources and differentiated instruction.\n",

The campus is a modern purposely-constructed two story building \u2013 built to meet the international standards of student safety, protection and comfort and equipped with modern ICT infrastructure to provide internet to all classrooms and offices with interactive smart boards in all the classrooms. The school caters for students as of KG1 to grade twelve and offers quality education to K12 students whose parents are interested in a private school option that is characterized by high standards of discipline and high academic expectations.\nOur priority is to ensure that both parents and students become actively engaged in our school\u2019s vibrant community and benefit from the curricular and co-curricular programs that are provided by our school.\nThe school\u2019s building has a library, three computer labs, seven science labs, three art rooms, a cafeteria, outdoor sport facilities, shaded areas, a multi-purpose hall, a clinic for a resident nurse and a part time medical doctor, classrooms that cater for 2000 students and offices for administrators. The successful school\u2019s student growth rate is mainly attributed to parent satisfaction which has contributed to the school\u2019s success (as evidenced in the Parent Surveys). The continual improvement and enhanced reputation of the school is expected to continue year on year, hence requiring further expansion of premises.\nThe school is currently setting plans to add an additional building with an indoor gym and another spacious multi-purpose hall, in addition to some supplementary classes for the KG and primary sections.\nOur staff comprises of 186 full time teachers, administrators and support staff. The faculty comprises of a school Principal, a Vice Principal, four Heads of departments, six section supervisors, a Social Counsellor, 85 teachers, 28 teacher assistants, 33 administrators and an additional number of support staff. All teaching staff possess the appropriate teaching qualification(s). This requirement is reflected in the selection process/policy prior to interview.\nThe modern CCTV system and surveillance cameras are installed throughout the campus to provide close supervision for all the school premises and common areas thusenhancing safety and security.\nThe school provides all parents with the option of \u201cuser-pays\u201d transport services care of the school-owned buses, where the emphasis is on safety, comfort and appropriate supervision while in transit. All buses are brand new, equipped with surveillance cameras, have up-to-date vehicle maintenance and safety checks routinely completed. They carry first-aid kits and have operational air conditioning. They are all complaint with all applicable transportation laws of the UAE.\nThe school uses the American Curriculum/CCSS in all key subjectsi.e. English, Math and Science and complies with the UAE Ministry of Education requirements in Arabic, Islamic Studies and Social Studies. The school complies with all statuary laws and derives its legitimacy from both the UAE Ministry of Education and Labour Law.\nThe main challenge for our school is the effective provision for SEN students as almost all such students approach our school for admission without prior assessment or identification of such needs. Most parents of SEN students are either unaware or unwilling to provide/disclose such important information upon registration which sometimes leads to some delay in discovering and referring such cases to licensed professionals for assessment.\nWe at SAMA American Private School base our educational philosophy on the Declaration of the Rights of the Child as adopted by the United Nations, Each child, as a unique individual, regardless of his/her ethnic background, should enjoy special protection, be given opportunities and facilities to develop physically, mentally, socially and spiritually in a healthy and appropriate manner in conditions of freedom and dignity.\nWe also believe that our main role is to inspire our students, ignite their potential through providing appropriate challenges and allowing venues for investigations, exploration, facilitation and careful monitoring of the learning process. The teachers as facilitators of students\u2019 learning will connect students\u2019 to their own growth and development journey, providing them with knowledge content and practical opportunities to develop their innate talents, skills and gifts in authentic situations with obvious connectivity to the real world. Students will have interdisciplinary opportunities for critical thinking and problem solving, as well as innovation, enterprise and entrepreneurship.\n",

We have as our primary purpose the developing of responsible and well-rounded bilingual students who will be able to meet the challenges of the 21st century with confidence and anticipation.\nWe also recognize that a modern school program must be grounded in sound and current education practice. To this end, we believe that staff development is an integral part of our school\u2019s success. We believe that children learn differently, and that instruction must be geared to the various learning styles in each classroom wherever possible. Also, we recognize the importance of the parent in the learning process and seek ways to involve the parent in school life. Above all, we believe that school should be a satisfying and enriching experience for each child.\nThe vision of Sharjah American International School is to create an open, collaborative school community that fosters the growth of responsible, confident, productive, and critical thinkers who are interested in the issues of their local and global communities and able to respond to different challenges.\nOur mission is to provide a Western education within a context that respects local traditions, to encourage academic excellence, to implement an inclusive learning environment that accepts students of all ability levels and provide for their needs, and to build responsible personalities that embrace 21st century learning skills and show interest in the important issues of the global community.\nWe wish to extend a warm welcome to the Sharjah American International School (SAIS) community through our website. We hope to provide you with information as well as some examples of what our staff and students achieve here. We are proud of the rich diversity of nationalities represented at SAIS and the manner in which the host country culture enhances the life of the school.\nWhile the prevailing religion is Islam, we host believers of many world religions and respect their beliefs. Our students from kindergarten to grade 12 have a multitude of opportunities to develop, both in and outside of the classroom, because we believe that every child is important and has a unique personality and learning requirements. Our graduates typically go to the best universities in the UAE, Canada, the United States and the UK. We have a strong tradition of excellence in Mathematics, the Sciences, and Information Technology, and have produced engineers, architects and doctors of the highest quality. Athletically, our sports teams routinely take home much coveted cups and medals and are viewed as the teams to beat in most competitions. However, what we are most proud of is the excellent reputation our students have earned in the community by acting responsibly as positive ambassadors for the school while staying close to home or traveling abroad.\nStudents leaving SAIS are quick to comment on the close bonds they enjoyed with their teachers and, after graduating, return often to our campus to maintain these positive relationships. Our attachment to our students is borne out of our belief that if we care about them as individuals they will ultimately thrive as students. We invite you to explore our website and gain a \u201cfeel\u2019\u2019 for what we believe is a really great school to be in!\n",

The school began as a small school with just the pre-school and primary section with about a hundred students on its roll. Initially, it operated from a villa in Al Fahya. In order to facilitate the increased strength of students, the school had to move over to a new campus in Al Qarain area, our present location.\nThe new campus opened its doors in 2008. We accommodate two separate wings-one that serves the MOE curriculum and the other that serves the British curriculum. The campus entails the Pre-Primary Section, Primary Section and the Secondary Section. With every strength in the school, grew the strength of the students in the school. Now, we are proud to say that our number of students has crossed over 2500. The cosmopolitan environment of our school entails students from over forty different nationalities. Regardless of the ethnic background they come from, we welcome them all equally wholeheartedly.\nStudents are admitted in the school at all levels starting from Kindergarten-1 to AS level in British Curriculum and Grade 12 in the MOE Curriculum. Students range from 3 to 18 years old at the time of admission. The students need to fulfill the requirement of a generalized skill-based entrance examination in English and Mathematics.\nThe Learning Resource Centre is another appeal that the children love to visit. They are accompanied by the English and Arabic teachers on a regular time-table basis. The school also prides its possession of play fields where students are taught different outdoor games. They are trained to participate in different inter-school competitions to bring home their accolades of sportsmanship. A well-maintained canteen with healthy and fresh food is one of the attractions that we have on offer. Water coolers, clean toilets with hand driers and sanitizers are some of the basic facilities provided by the school.\nThe teaching staff at Sharjah International Pvt School comprises of teachers, both male and female. The members of the teaching and the non-teaching staff hail from different parts of the world. Teachers teaching in British Section are mostly Non-Arabs, while the members of the staff in the Arabic Section are all Arabs.\nThe commutation to and from school is made as easy as possible by our experienced transport staff and a huge fleet of buses. The school provides transport to Sharjah, Dubai, Ajman, Al Dhaid, and Umm Al Quwain!\nWe sincerely hope that this website satisfies all your queries related to the admission procedures, academic calendar and curriculum.

We aim to provide our youngest pupils with preparation for learning that will build their confidence, introduce them to new experiences and give them the freedom to grow into socially prepared young people. We offer children a rich learning experience that enables them to develop a positive attitude toward themselves, their peers, and the school. Instruction in kindergarten is focused on developing foundational skills that prepare students for later learning in all content areas, including English language arts. Students who learn to read in kindergarten through grade three will be able to read to learn in later grades. A primary focus of language arts instruction in kindergarten is helping students make sense of the alphabet and its role in reading. It is critical that students develop phonological awareness so they can move on to decoding words; yet make sense of the reading in kindergarten is not merely decoding words.\nIn kindergarten, students learn beginning skills to comprehend and analyze what they are reading. Students begin to develop writing skills by using a combination of drawing, dictation, and writing to express opinions, relate an event, or provide information. Kindergarten students develop skills in speaking and listening through discussions with peers and adults. In both writing and speaking, students learn the conventions of English. Students also have to understand and use academic language to succeed in school. Academic language refers to the language of literacy and books, tests, and formal writing. It can be words or phrases that apply to specific content areas or that are used to express abstract concepts or feelings. Students learn academic language in context while reading, writing, listening, and engaging in discussions about books and grade-level topics.\nThe primary school aims to deliver a stimulating, broad and balanced curriculum within a positive and caring community where each child is valued. Children are encouraged to become confident independent thinkers who behave responsibly and courteously. Our dedicated teams of teaching staff provide pupils with the opportunity to develop a variety of skills, thus facilitating the fulfillment of their potential in academic and sporting capacities, specialist teaching and exciting experiences across the curriculum. These elements together create an inspiring atmosphere of motivation, energy, and success. A successful curriculum is the key to any child\u2019s accelerated learning and progress. In addition, it enhances the children\u2019s enjoyment and valuing of education. It leads to the child\u2019s independent ability as a life-long learner and encourages participation in further and higher education. With this in mind, we strive to provide a curriculum that motivates and challenges every pupil to achieve their best learning. We aim to provide a curriculum through which children look forward to coming to school every day and going home, telling of their experiences and learning. Throughout the year we will be following the recommendations of the current English National Curriculum.\n",

The school thus aims at making its own contribution towards establishing principles of social justice, equality of opportunity, genuine freedom, respect for religious and moral values enshrined in the constitution of India in conformity with the social standard of living and etiquette existing in the U.A.E. With this aim in view, the school gives adequate training for the students to become role models with innovative ideas and vision to work for the betterment of humanity.\nThe school started functional from 19th February 2018. The curriculum and programme of work is in accordance with the requirements of the Central Board of Secondary Education in New Delhi. The medium of instruction in the school is English, with Hindi as compulsory second language.\nArabic and Moral Education are taught as per the rules laid down by the U.A.E. Education Ministry. Islamic Studies is compulsory for all Muslim children. The children who leave the school with transfer certificate are eligible for admission to any school in India.\nA class room situation should be a situation where there is a healthy conversation that is carried on between the teacher and the taught, a participatory method of teaching. Each day would then add a new dimension to the child\u2019s profile giving him an opportunity to meet and accomplish new challenges. Teachers are expected to therefore, equip themselves with energy, integrity, creativity, enthusiasm and most importantly an openness of mind, which is vital for the development of the school in general and the child in particular.\nThe participation does not stop with the teacher and the taught but goes beyond the class room. An extended relationship is being established with the parents, who are now considered partners in the bringing up of the children. To comprehend correctly, the complexity and the composition of teaching is the name of the game. The term \u201cFlipped class room\u201d applies to the extended learning that happens at home. When a child goes up on to a podium or goes up to receive a prize, more often than not, the hard work of a parent behind the scene is what is evident.\n",
